PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION
</p>

<p>
To offer a volume of short stories to the
countrymen of Edgar Allan Poe and O. Henry is an
operation which requires nerve.  According to my
publisher it also requires "a foreword" which I
find, after consultation with the dictionary, is the
same thing as a preface.  Now to write a preface
to one's own book seems to me about as embarrassing
a task as any author can be asked to undertake.
It is like standing outside the front door
calling the attention of indifferent passers-by to
the more attractive features of one's own house.
They managed things better in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries when for a comparative trifle
some great artist like John Dryden was cheerfully
prepared to furnish a flattering introduction to
the work of any author on the simple understanding
that he was not expected to read the volume
in question.
</p>

<p>
Not possessing the pen of Dryden, and being
additionally handicapped by the fact that I have
read the accompanying stories, I find myself very
much at a loss how to fulfil my publishers' request.
Desperate situations demand desperate remedies,
and I will, therefore, tell the truth.  I wrote these
stories in order to satisfy an inward craving&mdash;not
for artistic expression, but for food and drink.  I
took a great deal of trouble over them, and if they
are not good they are at least as good as I could
make them.  I should not, however, have had the
audacity to offer them to the American public in
book form, except for the fact that they have sold
well and are continuing to sell well in England.
The most curious phenomena occasionally repeat
themselves, and it is with a wistful hope that
something of the sort may occur in the present case
that I venture to launch the <i>Scandal</i> on the
time-honoured trail of Columbus.

<h3>
The Cruise of the "<i>Scandal</i>"
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"One must never forget," said George solemnly,
"that rank has its duties as well as its
privileges."  I helped myself to another glass of
champagne.
</p>

<p>
"What is it you want me to do?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I have no wish to dictate to you in any way,"
he answered.  "I am merely offering you my
advice.  As your elder brother and the head of
the family, I naturally take an interest in your
career."
</p>

<p>
"Fire ahead," I replied gratefully.  "I'm
always ready to listen to wisdom, especially from
a Cabinet Minister."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," said George, taking a thoughtful
pull at his cigar, "my advice is that you should
accept this invitation from Lady Bulstrode, and
make up your mind to settle down."
</p>

<p>
"To do what?" I asked in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"To settle down," repeated George, with some
firmness.  "If you are ever going to do anything
with your life, it's quite time you started.  You
can't go wandering about the world in this aimless
fashion for ever."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't aimless, George," I protested.  "I
always have an excellent reason for going anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"And may I ask what your 'excellent reason'
was for spending the whole of last year in the wilds
of Kashmir?"
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to shoot a snow leopard," I said.
</p>

<p>
George shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly what I mean.  A year of your life
thrown away on a frivolous piece of sport."
</p>

<p>
"Frivolous!" I echoed.  "There's devilish little
frivolity about shooting a snow leopard.  You try
it."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said George coldly.  "I have
something better to do with my time."
</p>

<p>
It was plain that he was getting a little huffy,
and my conscience pricked me.  With all his
seriousness George is an excellent fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, old son," I said.  "Politics are all
very well for you&mdash;you've got a turn for that sort
of thing&mdash;but what on earth use should I be?  I
can't talk for nuts, and know rather less about the
game than this cigar."
</p>

<p>
George frowned slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Politics," he observed, "are not a game, and
with regard to your knowing nothing about
them&mdash;I suppose you can learn.  You have plenty of
ability if you care to use it.  Sir Henry Martin was
telling me only yesterday that your paper about
New Guinea in the <i>Fortnightly</i> was quoted by
practically every witness at the Royal Commission.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said I.  "That must be why the editor
wants me to write him something about Kashmir."
</p>

<p>
George nodded his head approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will do so.  Nowadays serious
journalism is as good an introduction to a political
career as you could possibly have.  Besides, one
would like to feel that all these years of wandering
about have not been entirely wasted."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they've not been wasted, George," I said.
"I've enjoyed 'em enormously.  The only thing is
they've rather put me off what people call
civilization.  I can stand a couple of months of London,
but I'm afraid I should get frightfully fed up if I
stopped here much longer."
</p>

<p>
George leaned back in his chair and drummed
lightly on the table with his fingers.
</p>

<p>
"That," he said, "is due to the fact that you
have no steadying influence in your life.  When
you have once settled down to regular work, you
will find that this unfortunate restlessness will
disappear."  Then he paused: "It would be a good
thing if you were to get married," he added.
</p>

<p>
"What, on my income?" I exclaimed; for I knew
George had rather spacious notions about the
family dignity.
</p>

<p>
George nodded.
</p>

<p>
"There is no greater help for a rising politician
than the right sort of wife," he remarked oracularly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear George," I said, "I don't want to
grumble about the size of my income&mdash;it has
always been ample for my simple tastes&mdash;but when
it comes to marriage and living in London and
being in Parliament, what the devil's the good of
nine hundred pounds a year?  Why, it wouldn't
keep some women in frocks!"
</p>

<p>
"There are some women," replied George, "who
can very well afford to pay for their own frocks."
</p>

<p>
I looked at him with surprise and pain.
</p>

<p>
"You are not doing anything so immoral as to
suggest that I should marry for money?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
George carefully removed the ash from his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"To contract an alliance with a wealthy woman,"
he observed, "is not necessarily the same as what
you are pleased to call marrying for money."
</p>

<p>
"No, George," I said.  "I hope I'm sufficiently
English to appreciate the difference."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," he went on, disregarding my
interruption, "marriage must always be a matter of
give and take.  If a woman brings you a reasonable
dowry, you, on the other hand, are able to
offer her one of the oldest names in the country, an
unimpeachable social position, and&mdash;er&mdash;a certain
measure of youth and good looks."
</p>

<p>
I picked up one of the Savoy tablespoons, and
contemplated my reflection in its highly polished
surface.  I can only conclude that it did not do me
justice.
</p>

<p>
"That's all very well," I said; "but where does
one find these gilded and easily pleased females?"
</p>

<p>
Again George's brow contracted.
</p>

<p>
"There are plenty of charming girls in society,
who at the same time are by no means paupers.
You are sure to find one or two at Grendon, for
instance."
</p>

<p>
I put down the spoon slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ho!" said I.  "Now I begin to understand.
We are expected to combine business and pleasure
this trip&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"If you mean to suggest that I have been talking
the matter over with Lady Bulstrode," said George
coldly, "you are quite mistaken.  At the same
time, I know she would be only too pleased to see
you make a sensible marriage.  She has often
asked after you when you've been away, and when
she heard you were in London she insisted on my
sending her your address at once."
</p>

<p>
"Lady Bulstrode," I said, "is a dear old soul.
I've always been in love with her ever since I was a
kid at Strathmore and she used to ask me over to
Grendon to shoot rabbits.  By the way, who's
living at Strathmore now?"
</p>

<p>
George looked at me a little suspiciously.  I
think he believed me guilty of trying to change the
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"There's no one there at present," he replied,
"except old Donald Ross and his wife.  I want to
sell the place if I can; it's no good to us."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't sell it," I protested.  "It's the only
one of our numerous family mansions I could ever
stand."  Then I paused.  "I left a boat there last
time I was in England," I added.  "I wonder
what's happened to it?"
</p>

<p>
"I should imagine it was there still," replied
George.
</p>

<p>
I laughed, and finished my champagne.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't suggesting you'd pawned it, George,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
A sense of humour not being my brother's
strong point, this little pleasantry fell on stony
ground.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't we wandering rather from the point?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," I said, with some cheerfulness.  "I
was just thinking that if I'm booked to go to
Grendon in ten days' time it's highly necessary that
I should have a short holiday first.  A smart
country house-party bang on top of two months of
London would just about finish me."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said George, raising his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's why I inquired about the boat," I
finished.  "I could just put in a week's sailing
nicely, and write my paper for the <i>Fortnightly</i> at
the same time."
</p>

<p>
George looked at me with a kind of pitying
interest.
</p>

<p>
"Am I to understand that you intend sailing
about the coast of Scotland for a week by yourself?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"A certain amount of solitude," I observed, "is
necessary for the production of great literature."
</p>

<p>
George shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are serious.  Personally I should
find it difficult to imagine anything less enjoyable,
or anything less conducive to work."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be sailing all the time," I explained.
"I shall make a snug little base on Kerrin Island,
and do my scribbling there."
</p>

<p>
"Kerrin Island!" repeated George incredulously.
"Why, the place is deserted.  No one
has been there for years."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they have, George," I said.  "I spent a
fortnight there last time I was home, and, what's
more, I built myself a most superior hut.  Unless
some of the fisher-boys have been monkeying
around, it ought to be as sound as ever.  I took a
lot of trouble over that hut."
</p>

<p>
At this point George, who had been consulting
his watch, apparently decided that I had wasted
quite enough of his time for the present.
</p>

<p>
"Well, please yourself," he said, beckoning the
waiter with a peremptory wave of his hand.  "So
long as you go to Grendon I suppose that's all we
can expect.  I shall hope to hear soon, however,
that you are adopting some really serious and
permanent interest in life."
</p>

<p>
"If it should take the form of an heiress,
George," I said, "I will wire you at once without
fail."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Exactly two days after this sporting promise I
found myself in the excellent company of the sea
and the sky about three miles off the land, near
Inverness.  I was not alone.  Sitting in the bows
of the boat, and looking out with interest towards
the approaching coast of Kerrin Island, was the
most disreputable rough-haired terrier puppy that
ever forced his society upon his betters.  His
name was Rufus, and he had been presented to
me by Donald Ross.  Perhaps it would be more
accurate to say he had presented himself, and that
Donald, with the simple philosophy of his race,
had merely acquiesced in the arrangement.  For
from the moment that I had arrived at Strathmore,
Rufus had joyously but firmly adopted
me as his new owner, and nothing short of
prussic acid would, I think have terminated the
engagement.
</p>

<p>
I must admit that I was glad of his society.
Not that solitude had any terrors for me, but still
a dog undoubtedly lends it a certain harmony that
it otherwise lacks.  One feels this more especially
at meal-times.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, there we were, Rufus and I, quite
contented with each other's company, and
thrusting our way merrily through the small
white-capped waves that rose and sank in the brisk
off-shore breeze.  Although only a four-tonner, my
little boat, the <i>Scandal</i>, was a rare sea-going craft,
and the faithful Donald had looked after her with
such honest care that the sails and rigging were as
sound as on the day when I laid her up.
</p>

<p>
Dressed in an old pair of grey flannel trousers
and a still older shirt, I must have cut almost as
disreputable a figure as Rufus.  George would
have had a fit on the spot if he could have seen
me, but I can't say that even this sombre reflection
depressed me very much.  Stowed away in the
locker I had a large hamper from Harrods', a
change of kit, a "Primus" stove, and a generous
supply of baccy and books; and if a man can't be
happy for a week on an outfit like that, all I can
say is that I'm devilish sorry for him.
</p>

<p>
There are two places on the island where you
can get a safe anchorage, one a small sheltered bay
on the further side, and the other a kind of
shallow estuary looking out towards Strathmore.  I
decided on the latter as being the nearer, and
steered the <i>Scandal</i> towards the struggling growth
of trees that half hid the entrance.  I struck the
channel all right first shot, and, running up the
cove, came round head to wind and let down my
anchor.
</p>

<p>
Rufus watched the proceedings with considerable
interest.  He evidently realized we were
going ashore; for the moment I hauled alongside
the tiny collapsible Berthon boat which we had
been towing behind us, he jumped in hurriedly
with a little yelp of approval, and sat down in the
stern-sheets.  Then he looked up at me and
grinned.
</p>

<p>
I hesitated for a minute as to whether I should
cart any of my stores ashore at once; then I
decided that it would be better to land first and
make certain that my hut was still in existence.
Quite possibly it had been spirited away in the
interval by some enterprising fisherman, and in
that case I intended to make the tiny cabin of the
<i>Scandal</i> my headquarters.  I am not lazy, but
there is a limit to one's enthusiasm for
single-handed house-building.
</p>

<p>
A very few strokes brought us to the shore,
which at this point consisted of a marshy stretch
of saltings about twenty yards broad.  I tugged
the boat up out of the water, and, preceded by
Rufus, who kept on looking round to see that there
was not some dark plot to maroon him, I picked
my way from tuft to tuft towards the edge of the
wild, heather-covered down of which Kerrin Island
is chiefly composed.
</p>

<p>
The whole place is only about half a mile wide,
but one cannot see the hut until one is almost up
to it, as it stands on the further side of the island
under the shelter of some rising ground.  I had
built it there purposely, so that it should be
invisible from the mainland.
</p>

<p>
Rufus reached it before I did.  Rounding the
base of the little hill, and coming suddenly into full
view of it, I found him lying on the grass,
contemplating his discovery with every symptom of
surprised approval.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my son," I said, "you may well look
awe-struck.  That superb edifice&mdash;" Then I stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm hanged!" I added incredulously.
</p>

<p>
There, just to the right of the hut door, I had
suddenly caught sight of a wood fire, crackling and
blazing away in the most cheerful and unabashed
fashion.  I stared at it for a moment in
amazement.  Yes, it was a wood fire all right.  There
could be no doubt about that.  And furthermore,
sitting complacently amongst the flames, I
perceived a large black kettle, from the spout of which
little jets of steam were shooting up into the air.
</p>

<p>
"Rufus," I observed, "there is some cursed
intruder here!"
</p>

<p>
Rufus looked thoughtfully at the kettle, and put
his tongue out.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said sternly, "I've seen that, but if
you imagine I am going to sell my birthright for a
mess of pottage you're mistaken.  Tea or no tea,
out he comes!"
</p>

<p>
I strode across the intervening grass to the door
of the hut, and rapped loudly with my knuckles.
The result was unexpected.  I heard a slight
exclamation, accompanied almost simultaneously
by the crash of falling china.  Then, very clearly
and earnestly, a rather sweet voice remarked
"Damn!"
</p>

<p>
I turned to fly, but it was too late.  There was a
sound of quick footsteps, the door opened abruptly,
and I found myself confronted by the prettiest girl
I have ever seen in my life.
</p>

<p>
She was dressed in a short blue skirt, with a
soft cream-coloured shirt, open at the neck.  From
under a red tam-o'-shanter her dark brown hair
hung down her back in two long plaits, reaching
just below her waist.  As for her face&mdash;well, I
always think a beautiful face is the most difficult
thing to describe in the world, but if you can
picture a Madonna turned wood nymph, and
delightfully sunburned at that, you'll be somewhere
around the mark.
</p>

<p>
For a moment her grey eyes contemplated me
with calm surprise; then her gaze travelled to
Rufus, who promptly sat up and wagged his tail.
</p>

<p>
"That," I explained, "is his manner of apologizing."
</p>

<p>
She turned back to me, and her lips parted in a
frank smile.
</p>

<p>
"I expect," she said, "that I ought to be apologizing
instead.  This is not my island, as&mdash;as you
probably know."
</p>

<p>
"It certainly isn't mine," I returned, "and you
were here first."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she said.  "I'll accept the apology.
After all, you've made me break a plate."
</p>

<p>
"Your nerves must be splendid," I said.  "I
should have broken a whole dinner-service."
</p>

<p>
She laughed cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"It was silly of me to be startled, but somehow
or other one doesn't expect afternoon visitors
here."  Then she paused.  "I don't know whether
you are a friend of the owner of the island," she
added.  "Indeed, I'm afraid I don't even know
who he is."
</p>

<p>
"His name," I said, "is George.  We are slightly
acquainted."
</p>

<p>
"And did he build this hut?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I said proudly; "I did that."
</p>

<p>
She looked a little embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"I really must apologize then," she said.  "I'm
afraid I've been making free with your property
in the most unpardonable manner.  I thought it
was a kind of desert island."
</p>

<p>
"So it was," I said, "before you came&mdash;a most
hopeless desert."  Then I hesitated.  "If you
won't think me inquisitive," I went on, "may I
ask how you managed to get here?"
</p>

<p>
She smiled.
</p>

<p>
"The same way that you did, I expect.  My
boat's round the bend there behind the trees."  She
pointed away to the left towards the small bay
which formed the island's other anchorage.  "It's
only a three-tonner though," she added regretfully.
</p>

<p>
I looked at her with some interest.
</p>

<p>
"Are you accustomed to roam about the high
sea single-handed in a three-ton boat?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," she said.  "Why not?  After all,
they are the easiest to handle."
</p>

<p>
"They are certainly the easiest to get drowned
in," I replied.
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders.  "One must take
what one can get in this world.  It's not my boat,
you see.  I only&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She was interrupted by a violent hissing from
the fire, which temporarily disappeared in a cloud
of steam.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!" she cried, in dismay.  "There's
the kettle boiled over.  You'll excuse me a minute
while I make tea, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
She dived into the hut, reappearing almost
immediately with a brown earthenware teapot in
her hand.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have a cup?" she asked, pausing for a
moment on her way to the fire.  "There ought to
be enough for two, unless it's all boiled away."
</p>

<p>
"You're very forgiving," I said.  "It's more
than I deserve after making you break a plate."
</p>

<p>
"It's the least I can do," she retorted, "after
jumping your hut like this."
</p>

<p>
She filled up the pot, and, coming back, placed it
carefully on the stump of one of the trees which I
had cut down when I built the place.
</p>

<p>
"This is the table," she said.  "If you'll sit
down on the grass and wait one minute, I'll bring
the tea out."
</p>

<p>
The suggestion seemed a sound one, so I
accepted it without protest.  Whoever my hostess
might be, she was certainly not lacking in
self-possession, and I felt sure that if she had wanted
any help she would have asked for it.
</p>

<p>
Selecting a comfortable place, I spread myself
out on the grass, and Rufus, who had apparently
been on a short tour of inspection, came up
sideways and licked my boot.
</p>

<p>
"Rufus," I said, "we have struck a remarkable
adventure."
</p>

<p>
He lay down and looked at me out of the corner
of his eye.
</p>

<p>
"We have discovered a mermaid, a sea-dryad,
an island goddess," I went on.  "In fact, I'm not
at all sure that we haven't found Astarte herself."
</p>

<p>
He rolled slowly over on his back and pointed all
four feet towards the sky.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to see," said I, "that you have a sense
of reverence."
</p>

<p>
It was at this point that, heavily burdened with
accessories, the goddess emerged from her retreat.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it's a poor sort of tea," she said, as I
jumped up to help her unload.  "Do you mind a
mug and condensed milk?  They're all I've got to
offer you."
</p>

<p>
"On a desert island," I said, "both a cup and a
cow would be painfully out of place."
</p>

<p>
"Still," she laughed, "I think if I were going to
be here long I'd give them a trial.  They might get
acclimatized."
</p>

<p>
"It's an interesting question," I said, "as to
which of them would be broken first."
</p>

<p>
Taking her various burdens from her, I began
to set them out in a half-circle round the teapot.
</p>

<p>
"If I'd known I was going to have a visitor,"
she said, "I'd have made some hot cakes.  As it
is, you'll have to be content with gingerbread and
biscuits."
</p>

<p>
Then she sat down opposite me, and began to
pour out tea.  I watched her with a most pleasant
curiosity.  I have been in a good many parts of
the world, and met some distinctly quaint people,
but this beautiful girl, with her perfect
self-possession and astounding absence of convention, baffled
me completely.  Who on earth could she be, and
what was she doing on the island&mdash;my island&mdash;or,
to be strictly accurate, George's island?  That
she was well educated&mdash;what I believe is known in
refined circles as "a lady"&mdash;was of course obvious,
but this only made the situation more puzzling
than ever.  I simply gave it up, and, accepting the
cup of tea which she handed across, waited calmly
for any further enlightenment that Fate might
vouchsafe.
</p>

<p>
"You shall have your hut by six o'clock," she
said, breaking a biscuit and offering half of it to
Rufus.  "I'll get my belongings on board directly
after tea."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you won't do anything of the kind," I
answered promptly.  Then, feeling that my
remark, though true and distinctly well intended,
was perhaps a trifle obscure, I hastened to add: "I
never use the hut when I come here.  I always
sleep on the <i>Scandal</i>."
</p>

<p>
"On the what?" she asked, opening her nice
grey eyes.
</p>

<p>
"On my boat," I explained.  "I call her the
<i>Scandal</i> because she travels faster than anything
else in Scotland."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes sparkled.  "I wonder if she could beat
the <i>Penguin</i>?  That's my boat.  I've only hired
her, but she goes like a bird."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you'll stay till tomorrow, we'll have a
race," I said.
</p>

<p>
She clasped her hands.  "It would be fun,
wouldn't it?"  Then she paused.  "But I don't
think I ought to," she added regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" I asked.  "Are you too proud to
share an island?"
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders, smiling.  "No,
I'm not proud; but it would put me in rather an
awkward position if somebody found out."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody will find out," I said reassuringly.
"The only person who will ever know anything
about it is Rufus, and he's a tactful dog&mdash;aren't
you, my son?"
</p>

<p>
Rufus, who was sitting up in expectation of
some more biscuits, gave a corroborative wag of
his tail.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," I went on, "you ought to give me a
chance of returning your hospitality.  I was
hoping you'd come and have breakfast with me on the
<i>Scandal</i> to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said frankly, "I'd love to.  Please
don't think I'm being silly about it, but I really
have to be careful what I'm doing.  You see, I'm
not supposed to be here at all."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," I said.  "In fact, I don't
believe you are here.  Things like this don't
happen in real life.  I shall wake up in a minute
and find you were just a delightful dream."
</p>

<p>
She laughed merrily.  "Well, have some more
tea first," she suggested, holding out the pot.
</p>

<p>
I waited until she had filled the cup, and then I
asked her a question.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I want you to tell me the truth," I said.
"If I hadn't come blundering in here, how long
were you going to stay on the island?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"The truth!" I repeated firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Another three days," she admitted.  "I have
to be back on Friday."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said, "if you don't stay those three
days, I shall never forgive myself.  I really don't
want to use either the hut or the island, on my
honour.  I've got my anchorage, and we shan't
be in each other's way.  In fact, you needn't see
me at all if you don't want to."
</p>

<p>
"But you've just asked me to breakfast," she
objected.  "You're not trying to back out of it
now, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll stay!" I cried joyfully.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes twinkled.
</p>

<p>
"I might," she said, "if you can really guarantee
the discretion of Rufus."
</p>

<p>
I drank up three-quarters of my tea, and poured
out the rest as a libation.
</p>

<p>
"It just occurs to me," I said, "that I haven't
introduced myself."
</p>

<p>
She made a quick, protesting gesture with her
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Don't then," she said, smiling.  "Let's stop
just as we are.  It will be much jollier if we know
nothing about each other, and Rufus can't betray
us then, even if he wants to."
</p>

<p>
"But we've christened you already," I objected.
"We've decided that you must be Astarte.  I
think she was the lady who came out of the sea
foam, wasn't she?"
</p>

<p>
Astarte made me a little mocking bow.
</p>

<p>
"You pay compliments very prettily," she said.
"I shall call you Stephen."
</p>

<p>
"Why Stephen?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
She jumped up smiling, and brushed some
crumbs from her skirt.
</p>

<p>
"You're shockingly ignorant of English history.
Don't you remember that Stephen followed
Rufus?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"Your wisdom leaves me breathless," I said.
"I can't go further back than Victoria myself."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I didn't know that, I shouldn't be
much&mdash;&mdash;"  Then she suddenly stopped.
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't be much what?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," she said.  "Let's put these
things away, and then I'll take you down and
show you the <i>Penguin</i>.  I'd like to know what you
think of her."
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
To describe the next few days would be rather
like trying to recapture some strange, delightful
dream after one has woken up.  I only know that
the time hurried away at that absurd and unnecessary
pace which Providence seems to reserve for
the more charming moments of life.  Of course,
our surroundings were not unfavourable to
romance; but, apart from that, Astarte was one of
those fragrant people who have the power of
throwing a kind of happy glamour over everything.
Underneath all her self-possession and efficiency
she had the heart of a frank and joyous child.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget her delight when she helped
me unpack Harrods' hamper on the first morning,
and dragged out the various delicacies those
thoughtful gentlemen had provided me with.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're the sort of person I like to be
asked to breakfast by," she laughed, dumping them
down one after another.  "A tongue, cold chicken,
<i>patÃ© de foie gras</i>, champagne, cigars.  Oh, Stephen,
you are greedy!  Do you always look after yourself
like this when you go exploring?"
</p>

<p>
"I lived for a month once on dried apricots and
snow," I returned; "but I don't do that sort of
thing from choice.  Besides," I added recklessly,
"I had a sort of feeling I was going to meet you."
</p>

<p>
She held up a reproving finger.
</p>

<p>
"You're not ashore now," she said, smiling;
"and no sailor should tell fibs at sea."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been reading Kipling's Brass-bound
Man?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said simply.  "My father told me that."
</p>

<p>
And this, I think, was the only occasion in all
the three days in which she volunteered any
information about herself or her life apart from
Kerrin Island.
</p>

<p>
It must be admitted that we had plenty of time
for exchanging confidences had we wished to,
Our day started at about 9 A.M., when, after an
early morning dip, Rufus and I would pull off to
the shore in the dinghy and meet Astarte, who had
walked over from the hut.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast followed, a merry, easy meal, lasting
about an hour and a half, after which I would sail
the <i>Scandal</i> round to the farther anchorage; while
my guest, in the teeth of all polite convention,
cheerfully washed up the cups and plates.
</p>

<p>
Then came the great event of the day, our race
round the island for the Kerrin Cup.
</p>

<p>
This trophy had been presented by Astarte
herself on the morning after my arrival.  She
had brought it over to breakfast with her&mdash;a painful
atrocity in green and white and gold, bearing a
purple label announcing that it was "A present
from Strathpeffer."
</p>

<p>
"We must have a prize, you see," she had
explained; "and I've been wanting to get rid of
this ever since I stole it."
</p>

<p>
"It's hardly an inducement to pulling out one's
best sailing," I objected, eyeing it with a slight
shudder.
</p>

<p>
All the same, we most decidedly did pull out our
best sailing; and the Kerrin Cup changed hands
with spirited frequency.  Astarte won it the first
day, I wrested it from her on the second, only,
however, to lose it finally and for good on the last
morning.  She sailed her little three-tonner with
wonderful skill and daring; and, seasoned as I am
at handling small boats, I found I was up against
an opponent whose education was every bit as
complete as my own.
</p>

<p>
It was all very jolly, but I think the evenings
were the best part.  We always had supper outside
the hut, to which I had transferred about half the
contents of my hamper.  With the aid of these and
Astarte's dazzling skill with the "Primus," we
used to fare as sumptuously as Dives, and I
warrant with much better appetite than that
hardly treated capitalist.
</p>

<p>
And when supper was over, and the things
washed up, we would lie round the wood fire that
we always made and discuss the morning's race,
and sailing generally, and any other pleasing topic
that happened to roll up.
</p>

<p>
And later on, when we had exchanged enough
wisdom, we used to sing songs to each other,
accompanying ourselves on the banjo which a
thoughtful Providence had inspired me to ship
on board the <i>Scandal</i>.  My own repertoire is
confined to strenuous efforts such as <i>Rolling Down
to Rio</i> and <i>Drake's Drum</i>.  But Astarte had a
charming voice&mdash;a deep, sorrowful contralto&mdash;and
she used to sing sad little songs about love and
death, which always seem to me the two best
things to make music out of.  Besides, they were
in such delightful contrast to her own splendid joy
in life.
</p>

<p>
It was only on the night before she went away
that I found out how fond I was of her.  She was
lying on the grass, her chin in her hand, and her
grey eyes staring thoughtfully into the fire, as she
listened to my description of some impossible place
in the ends of the earth which I had once visited.
Anything about the ends of the earth seemed to
appeal to her with peculiar force.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of my story it suddenly struck me
with an abrupt and painful sense of desolation
that on the following evening she would not be
there.  I went on talking, but somehow or other
all the interest and colour had died out of my yarn,
and I finished as lamely as George making one of
his official excuses for the Government.
</p>

<p>
For a moment or two she looked at me without
speaking.  Then she sat up.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Stephen?" she asked,
pushing her hair back from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing just now," I said.  "I was wondering
what Rufus and I were going to do to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"You must do that mysterious work you were
talking about.  You haven't begun it yet; and it's
all my fault."
</p>

<p>
"But I can't work when I feel lonely," I objected.
</p>

<p>
"Two days ago," she said, "you told me a
desert island was the only place you could write in."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said; "but I was younger then, and not
so experienced."
</p>

<p>
She laughed&mdash;that low, sweet laugh of hers that
always reminded me of deep water.  Then she
leaned forward again, and a sudden flicker of the
fire fit up her eyes and hair, and showed me
the soft curve of her lips.  She looked so utterly
adorable that for a moment I as nearly as possible
forgot the rules.  It was only with a big effort
that I crushed back a sudden wild impulse to take
her in my arms.
</p>

<p>
As it was I jumped up, just a little abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Astarte," I said, "it's time you went to bed.
All good sailors turn in early the night before a
voyage."
</p>

<p>
She looked up at me for a second with a grave,
almost a wistful expression.  Then she held out
her hand.
</p>

<p>
"You're right, Stephen," she said.  "Good-night."
</p>

<p>
I bent down, and very lightly I kissed the tips
of her fingers.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Midday the next morning found me, with Rufus
by my side, standing in sombre isolation on the
extremest promontory of the island.  Three miles
away the <i>Penguin</i>, now merely a white speck on
the water was just rounding the big bluff of
Strathmore Head.
</p>

<p>
"She's gone, my dog," I said, "she's gone!"  Rufus
looked out to sea and whined dismally.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said; "that's exactly how I feel.  But
it won't bring her back."
</p>

<p>
He threw up his head and howled.
</p>

<p>
"That's no use, either!" I added bitterly.  "If
it was I should do it myself."
</p>

<p>
Then, with a last glance seawards, I turned
round, and, followed by a very depressed puppy, I
made my way slowly across the saltings to where
the <i>Scandal</i> was at anchor.
</p>

<p>
I forget who first launched the theory that work
was a successful anodyne for baffled love.
Anyway, I can bear personal witness that he was
mistaken.  No one has ever worked much harder than
I did during my remaining three days on the island,
and no one has ever been more persistently
haunted by the vision of an absent face.  I wrote
the whole of my article for the <i>Fortnightly</i>&mdash;thirteen
solid, chunky pages all about Kashmir&mdash;and
at the end of it I found that I was even
fonder of Astarte than when she had left the
island.
</p>

<p>
"This is the mischief," I observed to Rufus.
"What are we going to do about it, my dog?"
</p>

<p>
Rufus wagged his tail and looked immensely
sympathetic, but beyond that he made no attempt
to help.
</p>

<p>
"We must find her, Rufus," I went on.  "We
must find her, even if we have to spend the rest of
our lives wandering about Scotland."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause while we both contemplated
this appalling possibility.  Then, with a
deep sigh, Rufus twisted himself round and began
to scratch his ear.
</p>

<p>
I watched him gloomily, wondering what was
the best way of setting to work.  If I had only had
some due, however vague, I could at least have
followed it up; but Astarte had gone away from me
leaving herself as much a mystery as ever.
</p>

<p>
Apart from sheer luck, my only chance of finding
her seemed to lie in tracing the <i>Penguin</i>.  She had
told me she had hired the latter, but when and from
whom were matters of which I knew nothing.
Still, a boat is a boat, and any yachtsman or
yacht-hand about the coast would probably be
acquainted with the little three-tonner, at all events
by reputation.  Of course, even then it by no means
followed that I should be very much forrader, for,
granted that the owner knew all about Astarte, he
might quite conceivably see no reason for confiding
in me.
</p>

<p>
It was a pretty little problem, and after pondering
over it all ends up I eventually decided that
the best thing to do at the moment was to go on to
Grendon, as I had originally arranged.  In the
first place, I couldn't get out of the visit now
without appearing rather rude; and, secondly, I was
just as likely to pick up some information about
the <i>Penguin</i> there as I was anywhere else.  Besides
I very much wanted to see old Lady Bulstrode.
She had always been nice to me when I was a boy,
and she was almost the only one of our family
friends who was not a confounded prig.
</p>

<p>
So on the Saturday morning, after fastening up
the hut, I came back on board the <i>Scandal</i> and
pulled up my anchor for the last time.  I couldn't
help feeling rather sad as we sailed down the little
estuary and turned our backs on the island, but
Rufus, with the callousness of extreme youth,
appeared to be in the best of spirits.  Anyhow&mdash;he
stood up in the bows and barked at the seagulls
with a vigour that suggested an entire lack of any
decent sentiment.
</p>

<p>
His only excuse for such disgraceful cheerfulness
was the weather.  It was an ideal September
morning, all blue and gold, with a nice breeze off
the sea, and that faint delicious crispness in the air
that almost reconciles one to the death of summer.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Scandal</i>, with every bit of sail she could
carry, leaped merrily through the water, revelling
in her job like the gallant little boat she was.  Even
my own depression was not quite proof against
such joyous influences, and by the time we ran
alongside the Strathmore landing-stage I had as
nearly as possible recovered my usual serenity.
As medicine for a disordered heart, I'll back the
sea against literature any day in the week.
</p>

<p>
Grendon, Lady Bulstrode's place, is only about
twenty miles from Strathmore as the crow flies,
but when one is hampered with a fortnight's
luggage and a dog, a crow is devilish little use
as a means of conveyance.  A motor would have
been by far my easiest method of getting there,
but George had not suggested lending me his,
and it was impossible to hire one nearer than
Rothnairn.
</p>

<p>
So after changing into the garments of civilization
and collecting my traps, which I had left
with Donald Ross, I was driven to jogging eight
miles in the latter's open trap, and picking up the
local Highland railway at Craigmuir.  This abandoned
me late in the afternoon at a little wayside
station some six miles from Grendon, where I had
wired to be met.
</p>

<p>
The Bulstrode family turn-out, with its magnificent
red wheels, black horses, and orange livery,
was waiting there in answer to my summons.
Rufus and I got in amid a general touching of
hats, and, reclining comfortably on the cushions,
rolled noiselessly off through the magnificent
Highland scenery.  For the first time I began to
fear that Rufus was a bit of a snob.  The languid
hauteur with which he acknowledged the
subservience of the staff was worthy of a newly
ennobled lawyer.
</p>

<p>
It was just six o'clock when we turned in at the
lodge gates of Grendon and drove up the long
avenue of fir trees.  I was received at the hall door
by the butler&mdash;a delightful old man whom I
remembered perfectly well from the days of my
boyish visits.
</p>

<p>
With the charming candour of an ancient
retainer, he at once began to comment on my
appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, Master Guy, but you've grown, sir!"
he remarked in an approving voice.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite possible, Parkes," I said cheerfully;
"especially as I was only fourteen when I was here
last."
</p>

<p>
"Fair grown out of all knowledge," he repeated,
looking at me with his head on one side.  "And
brown, too, though you were always a one for
getting sunburnt, Master Guy."
</p>

<p>
"I've not lost any of my bad habits, Parkes," I
replied.  "Where's Lady Bulstrode?"
</p>

<p>
"Her leddyship's upstairs in her own room.
I'm to bring you straight up to her, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Lead on, then, Macduff!" I said, smiling, and,
tossing my cap on to the table, I followed the old
man through the big hall with its innumerable
weapons and stags' heads and up the broad stone
staircase that led to the gallery above.
</p>

<p>
He stopped outside the door and tapped gently:
</p>

<p>
"Come in," called out a decisive voice, and,
turning the handle, Parkes stepped forward.
</p>

<p>
"Master Guy, milady," said he, as though I
were about fourteen, and just come home for the
holidays.
</p>

<p>
Lady Bulstrode, who had been writing letters,
jumped up with surprising alacrity.
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy!" she said, taking my hand in
both of hers.  "My dear boy!  I am so pleased to
see you!"
</p>

<p>
She looked just as she did when I had seen her
last in London, five years before&mdash;old, shrewd, and
kindly, with the same twinkling black eyes, and,
unless I am much mistaken, precisely the same wig.
</p>

<p>
"It's charming of you to remember me at all," I
said.  "Parkes tells me I've grown so big and
black that no one would know me."
</p>

<p>
Parkes, who was still standing by the door, made
a kind of expostulating murmur, and Lady Bulstrode,
with a laugh, pushed me gently backwards
into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down!" she said.  "Sit down and let me
have a good look at you."  Then, turning to
Parkes, she added: "Bring the whisky and soda
up here, Parkes.  I am sure Mr. Guy would like a
drink after his travels."
</p>

<p>
As the old man went out, Rufus, who up till then
had been keeping modestly in the background,
apparently decided that it was time he introduced
himself.  Anyhow, he came squirming out from
under the sofa and sat down with much tail-wagging,
in the middle of the room.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't help bringing him," I explained
apologetically.  "He adopted me at Strathmore
last week, and his motto seems to be the same as
Ruth's, 'Where thou goest I will go.'  Do you
mind dogs in the house?"
</p>

<p>
"I mind nothing," said Lady Bulstrode, "except
rheumatism and travelling third-class.  Come
here, boy!"
</p>

<p>
She held out a hand to Rufus, who crawled up
and seated himself carefully with his back against
her skirt.
</p>

<p>
"George told me you were in these parts," she
went on; "or, as he put it, 'pigging it upon some
absurd island off Strathmore.'"
</p>

<p>
"Dear George!" I said.  "He has all the simple
candour of a British statesman."
</p>

<p>
"He has quite a high opinion of you," returned
Lady Bulstrode, "though he thinks you're a little
mad."
</p>

<p>
"He's probably right.  Anyhow, I'm very
thirsty," I replied, as the door opened and Parkes
came in with the whisky.
</p>

<p>
I mixed myself a long drink and, at Lady
Bulstrode's command, lighted a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"I had a talk with George the other day," I said,
when the door closed behind us again.  "He
thinks it's quite time I settled down."
</p>

<p>
"What do you think about it?" asked Lady
Bulstrode.
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter," I said&mdash;"at least, not to
George."
</p>

<p>
My hostess smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Still, even unimportant things are sometimes
interesting."
</p>

<p>
"I think," said I, "that one Cabinet Minister in
the family is quite enough."
</p>

<p>
"Ample," agreed Lady Bulstrode hastily; "but,
after all, there are plenty of other openings in life
for an energetic and honest young man."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "and I've found mine.  So long
as my nine hundred pounds a year lasts, and I can
live on the workers, I'm quite content to go on
tramping round the world&mdash;especially if editors
will pay me for scribbling about it.  I'm a born
loafer, and I suppose when the world is properly
organized I shall be locked up in a labour
colony."
</p>

<p>
"At least you'll be in good company," said Lady
Bulstrode, "though I think you make yourself out
worse than you are," she added.
</p>

<p>
"No," I said.  "Mine is a useless life.  I've
never had any illusions on the point.  If I had,
George would have shattered them long ago."
</p>

<p>
"George," she returned, "is too serious to live.
I tried to get him up here for a few days, and he
said things were so bad at Westminster that
he couldn't be spared.  Those were his actual
words."
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"They would be.  There's no bally mock
modesty about George!  Who is here, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's no one at the present moment
except Alan's two children and old Mrs. Fawcett.
I have got a regular smart house-party coming for
you to-morrow, though."
</p>

<p>
She looked at me mischievously.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," I said; "I can bear it."
</p>

<p>
"There's Miss Faversham and her mother"&mdash;she
began to tick them off on her fingers&mdash;"a
good-looking girl, lots of money; her father is the big
contractor, Faversham and Kent, you know.
Then there are the Gordons&mdash;the K.C. and his
wife; and the McCullochs from Innestair&mdash;another
pretty girl there; and Raymond Sturgis&mdash;he's a
sort of cousin of yours; and old Lord Pembery
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" I interrupted.  "Do you mean
they're all coming in a bunch?"
</p>

<p>
"More or less.  They will be here to dinner,
anyhow.  I shall want you to play host, Guy."
</p>

<p>
I groaned.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it will do you good," she went on ruthlessly.
"You shall have Miss Faversham on one side and
the McCulloch girl on the other."
</p>

<p>
"If you're going to use threats&mdash;" I began with
some dignity.
</p>

<p>
A sudden tap at the door interrupted me.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" called out Lady Bulstrode.
</p>

<p>
I looked up, casually expecting Parkes, and for
one radiant, blinding moment I thought I'd gone
mad.
</p>

<p>
Standing in the doorway was Astarte.  She was
dressed in a plain black evening frock, and the plaits
of brown hair no longer hung down her back.  But
I knew her&mdash;knew her as instantly and surely as I
should know the sun or the stars.
</p>

<p>
So did Rufus.  With one loud yell of joy he leapt
to his feet and hurled himself upon her in wild and
vociferous delight.
</p>

<p>
"Bless my soul!" remarked Lady Bulstrode.
</p>

<p>
"Rufus!" I said, with a tremendous effort,
"control yourself!"
</p>

<p>
Astarte picked him up in her arms, and with a
couple of pats soothed him into something like
sanity.  She was plainly as amazed as I was, and I
could see her breast rising and falling rapidly as she
looked first at me and then at Lady Bulstrode.
When she spoke, however, it was in her usual
delightfully calm manner.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry," she said.  "I thought you were
alone."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Grace," said Lady Bulstrode, fanning
herself gently, "do all dogs take to you like that?"
</p>

<p>
Astarte put Rufus down with a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Only well-bred ones," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, let me introduce you both.  This is Guy
Heathcote, Grace; I've often talked to you about
him.  Guy, this is my friend, Miss Grace Conway."
</p>

<p>
I bowed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how to apologize for Rufus," I
said.  "I can only think you must be like
someone he knows."
</p>

<p>
"I expect I am," she answered with delightful
frankness.  Then, turning to Lady Bulstrode, she
added, "I came to bring you your change.  Here
it is&mdash;four pound ten."  And she put down a little
pile of gold on the desk.
</p>

<p>
"Did the mare go all right?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, we went in and out in great style, and
the children enjoyed themselves enormously.  I
mustn't stop to talk now, though.  I've promised
to tell them a story before dinner, and they won't
go to sleep if I disappoint them.  You shall hear
all about our adventures later."
</p>

<p>
She smiled&mdash;that dear, merry smile I knew so
well&mdash;and the next moment she had gone.
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.  Then I took a deep
steadying breath.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that beautiful thing?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"That," said Lady Bulstrode with some pride,
"is my governess."
</p>

<p>
"Your governess!" I repeated.  "What does
she teach you?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Bulstrode chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, when I say my governess, I am speaking
as a grandmother.  She is supposed to be looking
after Alan's children, though as a matter of fact
she looks after me just as much.  I don't know
what I should do without Grace."
</p>

<p>
I glanced at her with some sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"And how did you find Grace?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Lady Bulstrode shivered slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Guy," she said; "it reminds me of our
local 'minister'&mdash;a dreadful person.  Grace is the
daughter of the only man I ever loved&mdash;poor Jack
Conway."
</p>

<p>
"What, the explorer?" I said.
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
"When he fell down that stupid cliff and killed
himself, he left Grace absolutely unprovided for.
It was just like poor Jack&mdash;a dear, delightful man,
but quite hopeless about anything to do with
money.  I don't suppose he'd ever thought what
would happen to Grace if he died.  He took her
away from school when she was about sixteen, and
for the last three years before he was killed they'd
been wandering about the world together in that
absurd little ship of his, just as if she'd been a boy."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" I said thoughtfully, for I was beginning to
"smell land," as sailors put it.
</p>

<p>
"You see," went on Lady Bulstrode, "all Jack's
income, such as it was, died with him, and there
was nothing left for Grace except the copyright of
his books.  Well, goodness knows Grace isn't a
girl who wants luxuries, but, all the same, you can't
live on three volumes of travels, even if they have
been praised by the Royal Geographical Society."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds rather indigestible," I admitted.
</p>

<p>
"And so," finished Lady Bulstrode triumphantly,
"I persuaded her to come to me and help me
look after Alan's children.  Of course, she's much
too good to be a governess all her life, but I mean
to marry her to the first nice rich man who's got
the sense to appreciate her.  I've got one in my
mind's eye now."
</p>

<p>
I suddenly conceived a violent dislike for this
promisingly placed gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't think it would be difficult to fall in
love with her," I remarked casually, "unless one
has a rooted objection to girls being sunburned."
</p>

<p>
Lady Bulstrode laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, most of that will wear off&mdash;she has just
been for her holiday, staying with some old school
friends, and sailing about the coast, and living in
the open air.  I told her she'd ruined her
complexion, but I don't think she worries her head
about that kind of thing.  She's a born gipsy, just
like her father."
</p>

<p>
The booming sound of a gong from the hall
interrupted our conversation.  Glancing at the
clock, Lady Bulstrode got up from her chair.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Guy," she said; "that's the
dressing-bell.  I will take you up to your room, and
then you can tell me if there's anything you want."
</p>

<p>
Closely followed by Rufus, who was obviously
determined not to lose sight of me in this strange
establishment, I accompanied my hostess along
one side of the gallery, and up a small flight of
stairs which led to a couple of doors.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are!" she said, opening the one on the
left hand.  "It's Alan's old room.  I hope you'll
be comfortable, Guy."
</p>

<p>
I glanced round the big, splendidly furnished
apartment, and saw that my things were all
unpacked and laid out ready for use.  My eyes
took in the thick Turkey carpet, the deep easy
chairs, and the luxurious brass bedstead.
</p>

<p>
I looked up with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"I think I can rough it here for a night or so," I
said.  "I'm used to hardships."
</p>

<p>
Lady Bulstrode laughed again, and, giving me
an affectionate pat on the shoulder, left me to my
toilet&mdash;and my reflections.
</p>

<p>
I could have desired no better company than the
latter.  Indeed, my first impulse on finding myself
alone was to indulge in a kind of sacramental
joy-dance round the room; but the thought that there
might be someone underneath was sufficient to
restrain my ardour.  So I contented myself with
going up to Rufus, who had jumped on to one of
the chairs, and warmly shaking him by the paw.
</p>

<p>
"Rufus," I said, "we've found her&mdash;found her
first shot!  Who says there's no such thing as
Destiny?"
</p>

<p>
Rufus licked my hand, and then looked up as
though to convey his congratulations.
</p>

<p>
"We'll run no more risks," I went on.  "We
won't let her sail away this time, eh, my dog?"  Then
I paused.  "Why, damn it, Rufus," I added,
"you're sitting on my dress-coat!  Get off it,
confound you!"
</p>

<p>
He jumped down hastily in some apprehension,
but I was feeling far too cheerful to be annoyed.
When you have just found the woman you love,
even the spectacle of your dress-coat being used as
a door-mat fails to arouse any serious resentment.
</p>

<p>
While I changed I reflected pleasantly upon
what I would say to Astarte.  It was evident that
she had told Lady Bulstrode little or nothing about
her holiday; and I was glad to feel that the whole
of those delicious three days was still a secret
between us.  One thing I was determined about,
and that was that, if she was under any
misapprehension as to my feelings towards her, it
should be swiftly and effectively removed.  On
the island I had been handicapped, for any departure
from the jolly fiction that we were just casual
pals would have spoilt everything.  Here, however,
there was no such barrier.  We were meeting
on level terms, and it would not be my fault if
Astarte remained in any doubt as to how much
I loved her.  I went downstairs feeling what a
journalist would call "agreeably elated."
</p>

<p>
Dinner passed off in a very cheerful fashion.
Even the most sombre person would find it difficult
to be dull with dear old Lady Bulstrode, and
sombreness was not a vice from which any of us
suffered acutely.  Astarte, who had quite recovered
her usual self-possession, talked away with all
her customary good spirits and humour.  She told
us about her afternoon's adventures with the
children&mdash;two little girls of five and seven, to
whom she seemed devoted&mdash;and discussed and
described the coming house-party, most of whom
had apparently been there the previous year.
Like Lady Bulstrode, she seemed to entertain a
high opinion of the beauty and charms of Miss
Faversham and Miss McCulloch.
</p>

<p>
I kept up my end with a few picturesque details
about the ends of the earth which I still had left
over from our conversations on the island; and
Mrs. Fawcett, a charming old white-haired lady,
with a peculiarly sweet smile, gave us some
delicious reminiscences of the late Queen Victoria
at Balmoral, near which historic spot she herself
resided.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards we all adjourned to the big, rambling,
book-lined apartment which served a kind of
triple function as a library, a billiard-room, and a
smoking lounge.  Here, with the stimulus of coffee
and cigarettes, we continued to talk until about
half-past nine, when Lady Bulstrode got up from
her chair.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to bed, Guy," she said.  "These
good people are sure to keep me up to the most
scandalous hours all next week, and I mean to get
some beauty sleep while I have the chance.  I am
growing too old for prolonged dissipation."
</p>

<p>
"So am I, Mary," chimed in Mrs. Fawcett.  "I
shall come with you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to drag you off, Grace, unless
you're sleepy," went on Lady Bulstrode, turning
to Astarte.  "Perhaps you'll stop and play Guy a
game of billiards."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, please do, Miss Conway," I said.  "It's
against my principles to turn in before ten, and I
shall be frightfully lonely if you desert me too."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Astarte quietly; "but I expect
you're too strong for me."
</p>

<p>
Lady Bulstrode accepted the candle I offered her.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you believe her, Guy," she said.  "Grace
is a sort of female John Roberts.  She beats all the
men we have here."
</p>

<p>
"Mine will be an easy scalp, then," I returned.
"I haven't touched a cue for two years."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for you," said Mrs. Fawcett kindly.
"Good-night."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night," I replied, opening the door.
"At least one can die gracefully."
</p>

<p>
For a moment after they had gone out we both
stood silent and still.  Then I closed the door, and
came up to where Astarte was standing under the
big lamp.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," I said.  "Oh, my dear!"  And
taking her hands, I gazed steadily and happily into
her wide grey eyes.  She made no attempt to
release herself.
</p>

<p>
"It just shows," she said, "that you can't play
tricks with life.  I thought that for once we'd
managed to break the rules without being noticed."
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter?" I retorted.  "I have
found you now, and I'm not going to lose you
again.  Oh, Astarte, if you only knew how I've
missed you!"
</p>

<p>
"Dear Stephen," she said gently.  Then she
released her hands, and put them behind her back.
"I want to make things quite clear," she added.
"It's all one can do now."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," I said encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose Lady Bulstrode has told you who I am?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, in a way that explains everything.  You
see, I spent three years with father before he was
killed, and the whole of that time we were either
sailing about in the <i>Hyacinth</i>, or else making little
expeditions into places like Patagonia or New
Guinea.  You can imagine what effect a life like that
would have on a girl of seventeen.  By the time I
was twenty I'd almost forgotten that there was any
other way of living except in a ship or in a tent.
As for wanting anything else," she shrugged her
shoulders, "I don't suppose two people have ever
been happier together than father and I were."
</p>

<p>
For a moment she paused.
</p>

<p>
"Then," she went on, a little wearily, "he was
killed.  I can't tell you what that time meant to
me.  You see, somehow or other I had never
thought of life without him.  He was so strong
and brave and splendid, it seemed impossible that
he could die like other people.  I was trying to
think things out, trying to make up my mind what
to do, when Lady Bulstrode wrote to me and asked
me to come here.  So I came, and here I've been
ever since."
</p>

<p>
"And you've been&mdash;been happy?" I asked, for
want of a better word.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  Who could help being happy with
Lady Bulstrode?  She's the dearest, kindest,
jolliest soul in the world, and I owe everything to
her.  Still, as you see, I don't always tell her the
whole truth."
</p>

<p>
"No intelligent person ever tells the whole
truth," I said reassuringly.  "Half of it is quite
enough, as a rule."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was&mdash;about my holiday.  You
see, Lady Bulstrode would have been miserable if
she had known that I had hired a boat and was
camping out on an island by myself!  Of course, it
does sound rather a mad proceeding.  But after
wandering about with father all that time, I've
got a sort of craving for the wilds, and now and
then it gets so strong I simply can't resist it."
</p>

<p>
"I know, Astarte," I said.  "I know."
</p>

<p>
"After all, there was no harm in it," she went on.
"If you and Rufus hadn't turned up, no one would
ever have been any the wiser.  That did complicate
matters."
</p>

<p>
"You make me feel like one of George's official
explanations," I protested.  "I'd have gone, you
know, if you'd insisted on it."
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't want you to go a bit.  I was awfully
glad to have someone to play with.  You see, I
thought I should never see you again, and that it
wouldn't matter.  You can imagine what I felt
like when I found you were Mr. Heathcote."
</p>

<p>
"No," I said.  "I wish I could.  If it was
anything like as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose George is your brother&mdash;Lord
Mapleton?" she interrupted hastily.
</p>

<p>
"You're right," I replied.  "Though George
wouldn't be pleased at your way of putting it."
</p>

<p>
She made a pretty little gesture with her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, "it can't be helped."  Then
she looked up smiling.  "We must just forget all
about it," she added.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think we can do that," I answered.
"You see, I want to go to Kerrin Island for part of
our honeymoon."
</p>

<p>
She made a slight movement, but I went on
without giving her time to speak.
</p>

<p>
"My dear heart," I said, "do you imagine that
I'm going to let you go again unless you absolutely
send me away from you?"
</p>

<p>
Coming up to her, I took her two hands, and,
lifting them up to my lips, kissed them alternately.
</p>

<p>
She looked down on me with something very like
tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You're a dear, Stephen," she said softly,
"you're a dear; but&mdash;but it can't be."
</p>

<p>
"And why not?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said pitifully.  Then, with an effort:
"You see, I don't love you, Stephen."
</p>

<p>
I looked steadily into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"That's not true," I said calmly.  "I think
we'll tell each other the truth, dear, whatever it is."
</p>

<p>
"Very well."  She drew herself up, and her gaze
met mine frankly and unflinchingly.  "I do love
you, Stephen," she said, "but I'm not going to
marry you, because I know all about you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry for that," I said.  "It's certainly
enough to prejudice any one."
</p>

<p>
She smiled a wan little smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear, I didn't mean anything unkind.
I only meant that Lady Bulstrode has told me all
about your career and your ambitions, and how
necessary it is you should marry a rich woman.
Do you think I'm going to spoil your life because
I'm fond of you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," I returned, "but I think you
would if I gave you half a chance."  Then I
paused.  "As it is," I went on, "I shall simply
buy a marriage licence and a good second-hand
thirty-ton boat, and come and carry you off by
force."
</p>

<p>
"I won't, Stephen&mdash;I won't.  I'm simply not
going to ruin your career for you."
</p>

<p>
"My career!" I echoed.  "Do you imagine I
want to be a politician?  Do you think I want to
sit on a stuffy green bench and listen to people like
dear old George, when I can sail the blue seas and
love you?"
</p>

<p>
"It certainly does sound more attractive," she
admitted weakly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is," I said.  "It was what we were
created for.  We'll simply take up life where you
left it off when your father died.  I'll buy that
boat, and we'll wander about the world just as we
please for a thousand years, and we'll love each
other like the sea loves the wind and the night loves
the stars."
</p>

<p>
I stopped for breath, and, with shining eyes.
Astarte leaned forward.
</p>

<p>
"My Stephen," she said, "you make it very hard."
</p>

<p>
I took her in my arms and kissed her dear, soft,
half-open lips.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I asked softly, "have you anything
else to say, Astarte, before we play billiards?"
</p>

<p>
She looked up, and I saw the old, delicious smile
breaking through her tears.
</p>

<p>
"Only that I was right after all," she whispered.
"I said you were too strong for me, Stephen."
</p>

<h3>
The Man with the Chin
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I shouldn't like to marry a man with a chin
like that," said the girl in red.  Her companion, a
ferret-faced young gentleman with his hair parted
in the middle, inserted his eye-glass and stared
deliberately across the room.
</p>

<p>
"Obstinate-lookin' beggar&mdash;what?" he drawled.
</p>

<p>
Unconscious of these criticisms, George Leslie
sat at his solitary table, only looking up from his
newspaper whenever the door of the room opened
to admit a fresh arrival.  It was on the sixth
occasion that his inspection appeared to be successful.
His lips parted in a smile, and, laying down
his paper, he rose quietly from his chair.
</p>

<p>
The girl in red nudged her companion.
</p>

<p>
"She's come at last.  Kept him waiting long
enough."
</p>

<p>
The ferret-faced young man indulged himself in
another leisurely survey.  "Worth it, too, by
Jove!" he ejaculated admiringly.
</p>

<p>
His criticism, if a trifle crude in expression, was
sound enough in taste.  The girl who had just
come in was most distinctly worth waiting for.
Beautifully dressed, with a shy yet charming
prettiness, she moved across the tea-room towards
Leslie, and held out her hand with a little smile of
apology.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry!" she said.  "I know I'm dreadfully late."
</p>

<p>
There was a momentary twinkle in Leslie's grey eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-one-and-a-half minutes," he said.
"Not a record, Nancy, by a long way."
</p>

<p>
She sat down in the chair which he pulled up,
and began to take off her gloves.
</p>

<p>
"There's one nice thing about you," she answered,
looking at him with frank affection, "you
never mind people being late, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I occasionally make an exception in business
hours," said Leslie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, business!" She shrugged her pretty
shoulders.  "I expect you're simply horrid in
business, George.  I'm sure you bully all those
poor people at the garage dreadfully."
</p>

<p>
Leslie shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I leave that to Morton these days.  My time's
taken up in making them miserable at the works."
</p>

<p>
The girl laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I can just see you," she said.  "I suppose you
stick your chin out and growl at them like you do
at me when you're cross?"
</p>

<p>
"Something the same way," admitted Leslie,
"only not quite so violent.  You see, they're not
often as irritating as you are, Nancy."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him mischievously, and then
suddenly clasped her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, George," she said, "I'd quite forgotten.
Are you doing anything next Wednesday?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more than usual," said Leslie.
"About eight hours' work."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right then.  It's father's and
mother's wedding-day, and the old dears want to
celebrate it in some way.  I suggested that we
should go for a motor picnic to Beechwood&mdash;just
the three of us, and get you to drive us.  Don't
you think it's a lovely idea?  You know there's a
dear old church there, where Cardinal Wolsey was
married or died or did something, and you and
I can get away together after lunch and have a look
at it.  Both father and mother don't care for that
sort of thing, and they won't mind my going with
you.  You know father's taken quite a fancy to
you since you came round that day and showed
him the new car."
</p>

<p>
Leslie leaned back in his chair and looked at her
with a kind of amused gravity.  Then he shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"Things can't go on like this, Nancy," he said.
</p>

<p>
Her dark blue eyes opened innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Can't go on like what?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I mean I can't go on deceiving your people in
this way."
</p>

<p>
Nancy drew back, pouting.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, George dear, I thought we'd settled all
that."
</p>

<p>
Leslie smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You settled it, Nancy&mdash;I didn't.  But at the
best it was only to be a temporary arrangement.
Well, in my opinion, the time has come to end it."
</p>

<p>
"But we can't end it, dear," protested Nancy,
helping herself delicately to a chocolate Ã©clair.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Leslie.  "I can go to your
father and ask him whether he has any objection
to me as a son-in-law.  If he has&mdash;well, at least we
shall know where we are, and then you can make
up your mind what you're going to do."
</p>

<p>
"Now you're being horrid," said Nancy.  "You
know very well father won't let me marry you.
He thinks, because you've made your money
yourself, and because you run a motor-car
business, that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That I'm not a gentleman," finished Leslie,
smiling good-naturedly.  "Well, I can't help that,
Nancy.  Perhaps he's right.  My point is that it
doesn't alter the question.  If you're going to
marry me, you'll have to do it some day either with
or without your father's consent."
</p>

<p>
"There's no hurry," protested Nancy weakly.
</p>

<p>
"Not the least," admitted Leslie, "but, on the
other hand, there's no reason for waiting.  The
business is bringing me in an excellent income, and
we're only wasting both our lives."
</p>

<p>
Nancy stirred her tea, and looked at him sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"George," she said, "you'll make me cry if you
go on like that.  Why can't we stop as we are just
a little longer?  Something's sure to turn up."
</p>

<p>
Leslie shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing ever turns up in this world unless
people dig for it.  Come, Nancy"&mdash;he smiled at
her&mdash;"if you like me well enough to marry me,
surely you can't mind my asking your father
whether he objects.  I know you dislike rows and
unpleasantness of any kind, but there must be a
limit to everything."
</p>

<p>
Nancy wriggled rather unhappily in her chair,
looking prettier than ever.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what to do," she said forlornly.
"I'm awfully fond of you, George, and I would like
to marry you, really I would, dear, but I simply
can't go and have a nasty, silly squabble with
father and mother.  You know they wouldn't hear
of it.  They're frightfully old-fashioned, both of
them, and they think I'm sure to marry a duke
or something.  If I told them I wanted to marry
you, they'd have a fit.  I might just as well say I
was going to run away with the coachman.  Give
me some more tea, dear."
</p>

<p>
Leslie, who did not seem to be the least annoyed,
poured her out a second cup.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it seems pretty plain, Nancy," he said,
"that you'll have to choose between me and your
love of peace."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with a kind of mock despair.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, George, are you going to desert me, just
when I want your help?  I didn't think you were
like that, or I shouldn't have loved you."
</p>

<p>
"But you must make up your mind one way or
the other," protested Leslie, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Nancy shook her head despairingly.
</p>

<p>
"What's the good of telling me that, George?
You know I can't make up my mind; I never
could.  Someone's always had to do it for me.
Let's just go on as we are for a bit.  It's awfully
nice loving each other, and no one knowing anything
about it, and perhaps you'll save father's
life or something."
</p>

<p>
"If that's all it depends on," said Leslie
ironically, "we may as well begin printing the
invitations."
</p>

<p>
"Now, you're not to stick out your chin like that
and look cross," said Nancy.  "It's just as tiresome
for me as it is for you; and you ought to be
nice and sympathetic, instead of being grumpy."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a bit cross really," said Leslie.  "I
should as soon think of getting cross with a flower
as with you."
</p>

<p>
Nancy brightened up wonderfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's sweet of you, George.  I love people
to say things like that to me, and you so seldom do
it."  Then she paused, and looked at him with
mischievous, pleading eyes.  "And you will come
and drive us on Wednesday, won't you, dear?" she
added.
</p>

<p>
The corners of Leslie's mouth twitched.
</p>

<p>
"Nancy," he said, "you're as wicked as you're
beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear," said Nancy, "that's the second in
two minutes."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Colonel Peyton pushed back his plate, and got
up from the breakfast-table.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's a lovely day," he observed, looking
out of the window.  "I hope that young man will
be punctual.  Are you women ready?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever know mother late for anything,
Father?" inquired Nancy calmly.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Peyton chuckled, and shook his finger
at her.
</p>

<p>
"It's you I'm thinking of, miss," he said;
"you're the one that will keep us waiting."
</p>

<p>
"Come along," said Mrs. Peyton, "and put your
things on, darling.  We mustn't keep the car
standing."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Peyton, having been brought up with
horses, had never been able to rid herself of the
idea that a motor became restless under such
treatment.
</p>

<p>
Nancy laughed, and accompanied her mother
upstairs, from which region she shortly emerged,
looking bewitchingly demure and pretty in a sort
of Kate Greenaway cloak and bonnet.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel, who was just struggling into his
coat, gazed at her with fond approval.
</p>

<p>
"Very nice, Nancy," he said; "very nice.  You
remind me of your mother."
</p>

<p>
The compliment&mdash;to Colonel Peyton it was a very
genuine compliment&mdash;had hardly left his lips when
there came the loud hum of a motor-car driving up
to the house.  Nancy stepped forward, and opened
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Punctual to the minute," observed the Colonel
triumphantly.  "It's a pleasure to deal with a
young man like that."
</p>

<p>
The young man in question brought the car
round with a graceful sweep, and pulled up
noiselessly level with the doorstep.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" he said, taking off his cap,
and bowing slightly to Nancy and Mrs. Peyton.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel stepped out and offered his hand.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Mr. Leslie?" he inquired.  "Very
good of you to come round and drive us yourself.
Now you're making cars of your own you don't do
much of this sort of thing, I suppose&mdash;eh, what?"
</p>

<p>
"Not often," said Leslie gravely.  "Unless
people specially ask for me, I generally send one
of the men."
</p>

<p>
Nancy's eyes sparkled merrily.
</p>

<p>
"May I sit in front with the driver, Father?" she
asked.  "I love to watch him pull out the handles."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel looked a trifle embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;expect Mr. Leslie doesn't like to
be asked questions while he's driving, Nancy."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him curious that his daughter
failed to recognize that Leslie was a cut above the
ordinary chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
"I hope Miss Peyton will sit in front if she
wishes to," said Leslie.  "I don't in the least mind
being asked questions.  One gets used to it, you
know."
</p>

<p>
Nancy did not wait for any further discussion,
but jumped lightly up into the vacant seat, while a
solemn-looking butler proceeded to stow a hamper
into the back of the car.  The Colonel and Mrs. Peyton
then took their places, and Leslie, slipping
in his clutch, turned the car slowly round and
started off up the road.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful summer day of blue and
gold, and the twenty-five miles to Beechwood lay
through some of the fairest country in England.
Pleasantly warmed by the sun, and lulled by the
gentle drone of the motor, the old people lay back
in their comfortable seats, and gazed contentedly at
the passing scenery.  Not so Nancy, who, sitting
upright, with a demure smile on her face and
mischief in her eyes, proceeded to question Leslie with
an apparently artless enthusiasm as to the various
parts of the car.  He answered her seriously and
politely, never smiling or varying from the
respectful tone of a temporary employÃ©.
</p>

<p>
"I hope Nancy isn't bothering that young man
too much," observed the Colonel in an undertone
to his wife.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Peyton beamed good-naturedly at the
couple in front.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, people of that sort like to be asked questions,"
she whispered back.  "He's proud to show
off his car to Nancy; you can be sure of that."
</p>

<p>
"I only hope she won't make him run us into
a ditch with her chattering," was the Colonel's
rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
That this tragedy was successfully avoided may
be gathered from the fact that half an hour later
the car pulled up in a little woodland clearing just
above Beechwood village.  It was a charming spot
carpeted with soft mossy turf, and hemmed in on
three sides with trees.  From the fourth the
Buckinghamshire countryside stretched out in a
magnificent rolling panorama of twenty miles.
</p>

<p>
After a brief and whispered consultation with his
wife, Colonel Peyton turned to Leslie.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you'll lunch with us, Mr. Leslie," he
said.  "We have brought plenty for four."
</p>

<p>
Leslie bowed.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very pleased to," he answered.  And
going round to the back of the car, he proceeded to
assist Nancy in getting out the hamper.
</p>

<p>
The lunch looked most attractive spread out on
a clean white cloth, for, like many elderly soldiers,
Colonel Peyton regarded food as only slightly
inferior in importance to religion and good
breeding.  Seated beside Mrs. Peyton, Leslie found
himself being patronized by that complaisant lady
with all the well-meaning condescension of her
kind.
</p>

<p>
"You must eat a good lunch, Mr. Leslie," she
observed, helping him generously to cold game-pie.
"I am sure it must be most tiring driving that
great heavy car."
</p>

<p>
"To say nothing of answering all your questions&mdash;eh,
Nancy?" put in the Colonel.  "Have some
champagne?"  He held out the bottle to Leslie.
</p>

<p>
The latter filled up Mrs. Peyton's glass, and then
helped himself.
</p>

<p>
"Driving a car nowadays isn't a very tiring
business," he explained, "especially when one is
used to it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I mean to try it before long," said the
Colonel.  "One has to take to the infernal things
in self-defence&mdash;what?  I shall probably come
down on you, now you've taken to making cars
yourself.  Sir Herbert Temple tells me they're
excellent."
</p>

<p>
Nancy clapped her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Father, that will be delightful!" she said.
"And can't you get Mr. Leslie to come and drive us?"
</p>

<p>
Leslie bit his lip to stop himself from smiling.
</p>

<p>
"My dear child," said the Colonel, "Mr. Leslie
is much too busy a man for that sort of thing.  It's
very good of him to come to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the motor-car business is a very
thriving industry," hazarded Mrs. Peyton vaguely.
"Do you make them yourself, Mr. Leslie?"
</p>

<p>
"With a little assistance," answered Leslie.
"It's rather complicated work, you know."
</p>

<p>
"It must be," said Mrs. Peyton sympathetically.
"The tyres alone, for instance.  I can't think how
you cut all those funny patterns on the rubber.
What a perfect day for a picnic, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Having taken this abrupt Ã¦sthetic turn, the
conversation wandered away into general channels,
until by a natural process it drifted back to the
immediate surroundings of the party.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see the church," said Nancy, throwing
a little sidelong glance at Leslie.  "I believe
it's most awfully interesting.  Cardinal Wolsey did
something or other in it."
</p>

<p>
"The church, the church?" inquired Colonel
Peyton in whom lunch had induced certain
symptoms of restfulness.  "What church?  Where
is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe it's down in the village," answered
Nancy innocently.  "I could walk down and back
before you are ready to start."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you'd better," said the Colonel.
"You'll probably meet some drunken tramp."
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps Mr. Leslie would walk down
with me," suggested Nancy.  "I do want to see
the church frightfully.  That was why I
suggested Beechwood."
</p>

<p>
"I should be delighted to," said Leslie simply.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Peyton looked a little doubtful.  The
young man certainly seemed most respectful and
well-mannered, but&mdash;but&mdash;well, well, after all,
where was the harm.  Having asked him to lunch,
it would appear rather unkind to refuse his
well-meant offer, especially as the suggestion had
originally come from Nancy.
</p>

<p>
"Go along with you, then," said the Colonel
good-naturedly.  "But don't be late.  We want
to start back by three."
</p>

<p>
Side by side, Nancy and Leslie set off down the
hill.  For some little way Nancy was bubbling
over with suppressed merriment, which only found
its escape when they rounded the corner of the hill
and were out of sight of the older people.  Then
she thrust her arm through Leslie's, and broke into
a long ripple of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, George dear," she said.  "I thought I
should have exploded.  Your face was simply
lovely!"
</p>

<p>
Leslie smiled contentedly.
</p>

<p>
"If it comes to that," he retorted, "you're
looking rather nice yourself this morning,
Nancy."
</p>

<p>
Nancy squeezed his arm gently.
</p>

<p>
"That's very pretty," she said, "but you
mustn't say that sort of thing too often, George,
or I shall think you've been practising.  Where are
we going to?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, to the church, of course," answered Leslie.
</p>

<p>
Nancy wrinkled her nose.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want to go to the church," she
protested.  "It's sure to be all dusty and stuffy,
and there'll be some horrid old man who'll want to
crawl round with us and point out Cardinal Wolsey.
Let's go and sit in the wood somewhere, and just
talk."
</p>

<p>
Leslie shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, Nancy," he said sternly.  "I can't
encourage such deception.  Come along to the
church."
</p>

<p>
Nancy sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear," she murmured, "that's the worst of
loving a man with a chin like yours.  I shouldn't
be half so frightened of you if you had a beard,
George.  Will you grow one to please me when
we're married?"
</p>

<p>
"You shall have whiskers if you want them,"
said Leslie tenderly.
</p>

<p>
Nancy laughed, and, withdrawing her arm,
stopped to pick two or three flowers that were
nestling in the hedgerow.
</p>

<p>
"There you are," she said, putting them in his
buttonhole.  Then she turned up her face.  "You
may kiss me now if you like."
</p>

<p>
Leslie put his hands on her shoulders, and kissed
her very gently.
</p>

<p>
Nancy patted his sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"You dear, obstinate old thing!" she said.  "I
believe you like me rather, after all."
</p>

<p>
"I do a little," said Leslie quietly.
</p>

<p>
Walking side by side, they came out on to the
bend of the hill that leads down into Beechwood
village.  The small hamlet with its thatched
cottages lay spread out below them in the warm
July sunshine.
</p>

<p>
"What a sweet place, isn't it?" said Nancy.
"There's the church."  She pointed down to a
little square tower, half hidden amongst the trees.
"And, oh, look!" she added.  "There's someone
outside with a motor-car.  I suppose he's come to
see Cardinal Wolsey too."
</p>

<p>
Leslie said nothing.  He was busy flicking away
some dust from his coat with his handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"He's left the car and gone inside," went on
Nancy.  "What fun!  Let's steal it, George, and
go for a ride!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think we'd better," said Leslie.  "He
might be the bishop inspecting."
</p>

<p>
Nancy shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Bishops never inspect," she said decidedly.
"They sit at home and swear at the Government.
I know, because my uncle's one."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll go inside too, and see what he's
doing," said Leslie.  "Perhaps he's breaking open
the poor-box."
</p>

<p>
They turned in under the old wooden gateway
and walked up the churchyard path.  The door
of the porch was open, and as they entered Leslie
closed it behind them.  At that moment the organ
broke softly into music.
</p>

<p>
Nancy slipped her arm into her companion's.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!" she whispered.  "I believe there's a
service on."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke an elderly clergyman in a surplice
came out suddenly from a side door in the chancel.
He walked slowly to the steps, and stood there
with a book in his hand looking down the aisle
towards them.
</p>

<p>
"It's our wedding service," said Leslie simply.
</p>

<p>
All the colour went suddenly out of Nancy's
face.  She stood for a moment as if turned to
white marble, while the sound of the organ rose
louder and louder, mounting up triumphantly into
the fretted roof, and filling all the church with its
joyous harmony.  She tried to speak, but somehow
or other the words refused to come.  Then she
felt Leslie's arm tighten, and she was walking up
the aisle, while the music sank and died in low,
melodious tones.  She had a vague impression of
two men getting up from the front pew.
</p>

<p>
"Gathered together&mdash;sight of God&mdash;face of this
congregation&mdash;join together&mdash;man and woman&mdash;holy
matrimony&mdash;honourable estate instituted&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But this was impossible, absurd.  She couldn't
be married like this.  What was Leslie thinking
of?  The man must stop.
</p>

<p>
The monotonous drone continued:
</p>

<p>
"Have this woman&mdash;wedded wife&mdash;live together&mdash;God's
ordinance&mdash;holy estate matrimony&mdash;lover,
comfort, honour, an' keeper&mdash;sickness and in
health&mdash;forsaking all other, keep thee only unto
her so long as ye both shall live?"
</p>

<p>
Leslie's voice came, cheerful and distinct:
</p>

<p>
"I will."
</p>

<p>
"Have this man&mdash;wedded husband&mdash;live
together&mdash;God's ord'nance&mdash;holy estate matrimony.
Obey him, serve him, love, honour, and keep
him&mdash;sickness&mdash;health&mdash;forsaking all other, keep thee
only unto him so long as ye both shall live?"
</p>

<p>
Nancy gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Who giveth this woman&mdash;married&mdash;this man?"
</p>

<p>
There was a shuffle of feet, and somebody
stepped forward beside her.
</p>

<p>
Nancy found herself holding Leslie's hand.  Her
mind seemed to be a whirling wilderness of amazed
protest.  What was she to do?  Why hadn't she
spoken before?  She wouldn't be married like
this&mdash;she wouldn't&mdash;she wouldn't!  It was hateful of
Leslie!  She'd&mdash;she'd&mdash;What was it the man
wanted her to say?
</p>

<p>
"I, Nancy, take thee, George&mdash;wedded
husband&mdash;have and to hold&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Somehow she had stumbled through the responses,
and then she was kneeling beside Leslie,
and her hand was still in his.
</p>

<p>
It was too late now.  She was married&mdash;married&mdash;married,
and all the protests in the world would
be worse than useless.  Even the parson's drone
seemed to ring with a note of finality.
</p>

<p>
"Those whom God hath joined together let no
man put asunder."
</p>

<p>
Of what happened immediately after, Nancy
never had any very clear idea.  She remembered
signing a book, and shaking hands with two
complete strangers, and being congratulated by the
old clergyman.  And at last she and Leslie were
alone.
</p>

<p>
It was then that Nancy began to cry.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, dearest, don't!" said Leslie.
</p>

<p>
He took her in his arms, and kissed her wet eyes
and quivering lips.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how could you&mdash;how could you?"  She
hid her face against his coat, and somehow the
laughter forced its way through her tears.  "Oh,
George, you beast, you beast, you bully!"
</p>

<p>
"It was the only way, my Nancy."
</p>

<p>
His voice was very tender, and the steady grey
eyes looked down on her alight with love.  She
took his handkerchief out of his pocket and dabbed
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I'll never forgive you&mdash;never!  It was horrible
of you, George!"  Then came the old mischievous
smile, like a flash of sunshine through the rain.
"However did you do it, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I got a special licence on Saturday," said Leslie
calmly.  "Then I came down here, saw the parson,
and told him to be ready at two o'clock.  I said we
might keep him waiting, so I would pay double
fees."
</p>

<p>
Nancy burst into a ripple of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, George," she said, "I think you must be
the devil!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he took up the bargain quick enough.
Then I told Morton, my partner, to come down
with another car and wait outside the churchyard.
Directly he saw me coming he was to go in and
start the parson, and that's how everything was
ready.  It was quite a simple matter, really."
</p>

<p>
"But it's only just beginning," said Nancy.
"Think of father and mother."
</p>

<p>
"I have," said Leslie.  "Morton is driving
them home.  I have given him a letter explaining
the circumstances.  We shall go back in the other
car."
</p>

<p>
Nancy collapsed.
</p>

<p>
"And then?" she inquired faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall take you to Claridge's, and go round
and see your father.  I want to apologize to him."
</p>

<p>
Nancy shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think he'll say?"
</p>

<p>
Leslie took her two hands and drew her towards
him.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," he said, "your father and I are going
to be great friends."
</p>

<p>
She looked up into his strong, kind face.  Then
she gave a little happy laugh.
</p>

<p>
"George," she said, "I'm glad you've got a chin
like that.  It makes me feel so safe."
</p>

<h3>
Tony and His Conscience
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The taxi pulled up with a jerk opposite Hyde
Court Mansions, and the Honourable Reginald
Seton, in the glossiest of top hats and the most
delicate of grey frock-coats, stepped out carefully
on to the pavement.  Then, with the graceful
deliberation that marked all his movements, he
extracted half-a-crown from his waistcoat pocket
and handed it to the driver.
</p>

<p>
The man pocketed the coin with a wheezy
"Thank ye, sir," and, leaning over from his box,
inquired furtively, "Wot's goin' to win ter-day,
guv'nor?"
</p>

<p>
Reggie sighed.
</p>

<p>
"My bookmaker," he said, adjusting his
field-glasses to a nicer angle.  Then, with his head
slightly on one side, he mounted the two or
three stone steps that led into the big block of
flats.
</p>

<p>
The liftman, who looked like a dirty edition of
the All Highest, touched his cap as Reggie
approached.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Delmar's flat, sir?" he inquired, opening
the door.
</p>

<p>
Reggie nodded.
</p>

<p>
"They tell me, sir," pursued the liftman, as he
and Reggie progressed heavenwards, "that Little
Eva's very 'ot to-day&mdash;very 'ot indeed, sir."
</p>

<p>
"How unpleasant for her jockey!" replied
Reggie, with a slight shudder.
</p>

<p>
The liftman smiled respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"It's a good tip, sir," he observed.  "I 'ad it
straight from the stable."
</p>

<p>
Reggie looked at him with admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Did you really, Smith?" he said.  "How clever
of you!  The only things I've ever had from a
stable have been bills."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, sir," said the liftman indulgently,
"you can afford to pay 'em."
</p>

<p>
Reggie shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"That's just where you're wrong, Smith; I can
afford not to&mdash;which is much more important."
</p>

<p>
The lift stopped at the third landing, and
Mr. Smith flung back the trellised iron gate.  Then he
stepped out after Reggie, and, crossing to the door
exactly opposite, pressed the electric bell.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Smith," said Reggie languidly;
"you are very efficient."
</p>

<p>
The bell was answered by a middle-aged,
clean-shaven man with a face like a tired mask.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Ropes," said Reggie.  "Is
Mr. Delmar up?"
</p>

<p>
Ropes stepped back, opening the door.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Delmar is dressing, sir; I think he is
expecting you."
</p>

<p>
"I know he is," said Reggie, advancing into the
hall, and beginning to take off his gloves.  "Has
he ordered the car?"
</p>

<p>
"Nine-thirty sharp, sir."
</p>

<p>
Reggie smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well," he said, "I think we shall be ready
by ten, with any luck."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," replied Ropes; "I should think so, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You were always an optimist, Ropes," said
Reggie.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a door on the farther side of the
hall was thrown open and a voice&mdash;a peculiarly
engaging, good-tempered sort of voice&mdash;inquired
cheerfully:
</p>

<p>
"That you, Reggie?"
</p>

<p>
Reggie laid down his hat and stick on the settee.
</p>

<p>
"The answer," he said, "is in the affirmative."
</p>

<p>
"Well, come in," replied the voice, "and don't
be an ass."
</p>

<p>
Accepting the first suggestion, Reggie walked
across the hall.
</p>

<p>
The room which he entered was as comfortable
as a man's bedroom has any right to be.  A wood
fire was crackling away pleasantly in the grate,
and reflecting a comfortable glow on the two or
three excellent specimens of Mr. Finch Stuart's
talent which hung upon the walls.
</p>

<p>
On the bed sat Tony, tastefully draped in a
white Turkish bath robe.  He was smoking a
cigarette and helping himself out of a bottle of
champagne from the table beside him.
</p>

<p>
Reggie looked at him reprovingly.
</p>

<p>
"Tony," he said, "I thought you had long ago
abandoned that disgusting English habit of eating
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"You have always misjudged me," he said.
"My real tastes are as simple as a schoolboy's.
Have some?"
</p>

<p>
He poured out a glass and handed it to Reggie,
at the same time casting a critical eye over the
latter's clothes.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Reggie," he said, "you are very
beautiful, but do you think that's the most
suitable costume for motoring down to Newmarket
in?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite," said Reggie contentedly, "if one goes
inside."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," replied Tony, "you've arranged it, have
you?  May I hear the details?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Reggie, sipping gracefully
from his glass.  "You will perform your usual
miracles with the steering-wheel, Musette will
watch you with grave approval, and Gwendoline
and I will sit behind and hold hands."
</p>

<p>
"And suppose Musette wants to go inside?"
</p>

<p>
Reggie smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I am not the least afraid of that," he said.
</p>

<p>
Tony got up from the bed and began to shed his
bath robe.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you had better hold Gwendoline's hand
as engagingly as you can," he said.  "It will
probably be your last chance, as far as I'm
concerned."
</p>

<p>
Reggie looked at him with a faint wrinkle in his
forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a riddle, Tony?" he asked plaintively.
"I am no good at riddles unless I'm slightly
drunk."
</p>

<p>
"The answer," said Tony, selecting a shirt with
some care, "is Little Eva.  It's very painful, but
the fact remains that if Little Eva doesn't win
to-day there's an end of Antony Delmar."
</p>

<p>
Reggie paused in the act of lighting a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"You're not thinking of poisoning yourself, are
you, Tony?" he asked, with interest.  "Because,
if so, a doctor chap once told me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You're always very helpful, Reggie," he said;
"but, as a matter of fact, I've not the least idea of
doing anything so exciting.  I only mean that
unless Little Eva brings it off we've finished this
particular chapter.  I've no doubt Ropes will lend
me a tenner, but, bar that, I shall be what Pat
O'Donnell used to call 'bruk to the buff.'"
</p>

<p>
For the first time Reggie looked a little serious.
</p>

<p>
"Are things really as bad as that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Worse," said Tony calmly.  "Much worse.
There are my unhappy tradesmen to be considered.
That's the only point that worries me.  I hate
doing a tradesman, Reggie, but I'm afraid I shall
have to."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you will," said Reggie hopefully.
"We're always having to do unpleasant things in
this life.  It's what my uncle the bishop calls
'our duty,'  You'll have to go bankrupt, Tony,
and then borrow a few thousands and start over
again."
</p>

<p>
Tony, who was adjusting his tie with some care,
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"It's a good idea," he said, "but, unfortunately,
I've rather forestalled it.  The five thousand that
I've got on Little Eva with Morris and Weaver
was a sort of farewell testimonial from my friends.
I think I touched everyone except you and Ropes,
and Ropes has been paying the bills for at least
a fortnight.  I really can't go on any longer, or
the poor fellow will have lost all he's robbed
me of."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say you've put the actual
cash up?" demanded Reggie in horror.
</p>

<p>
"I had to, my dear Reggie.  That little beast
Murray, who runs the business, wouldn't take a
'pony' from me unless he saw the colour of it
first."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you stand to win?"
</p>

<p>
Tony sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-seven thousand pounds," he said.
"It's a beautiful sum, isn't it?  I could pay my
bills and live for nearly three years on it."
</p>

<p>
Reggie poured himself out the remainder of the
champagne.
</p>

<p>
"You make me feel quite faint, Tony," he said,
"you're so spacious."  Then he took a long drink.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you propose doing," he added, "if
Little Eva's beaten?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to work," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
Reggie stared at him in unaffected amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Have to what?" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Work," repeated Tony.  "I believe it's very
difficult and unpleasant, but I don't see any other
prospect."
</p>

<p>
A mingled look of horror and admiration crept
across Reggie's face.
</p>

<p>
"What could you do?" he asked breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"I might drive a car," answered Tony hopefully.
"I can't think of anything else at the moment."
</p>

<p>
Reggie took a deep breath,
</p>

<p>
"You're splendid, Tony," he said.  "You remind
me of Roosevelt.  But of course it's absurd.
You must marry some woman with money.  There
are plenty of them who'd jump at you."
</p>

<p>
Tony shivered.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy being jumped at by a woman!" he said
plaintively.  "It makes me feel like a new hat."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're a bad hat," retorted Reggie,
laughing; "that's quite near enough.  Seriously,
though, my dear Tony, you can't possibly be
allowed to go under.  London would never be the
same again.  It would be as bad as Romano's
being burnt down.  You must marry, of course.
What's the use of being the most popular man in
London if you can't marry a rich woman when you
want to?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, suggest somebody."
</p>

<p>
Reggie pondered for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Why not Mrs. Rosenbaum?"
</p>

<p>
Tony picked an errant thread off his perfectly
cut blue suit.  "In order to be facetious, Reggie,"
he said, "it is not necessary to be disgusting."
</p>

<p>
Reggie sighed.
</p>

<p>
"I am doing my best," he declared.  "What
about Musette?  She obviously has the good taste
to appreciate you, and she seems to have plenty
of money.  By the way, Tony, who is she really?
Cohen asked me about her after he met her with
you at Kempton, and when I said I didn't know,
the swine grinned.  If I hadn't had a pair of
Gordon's boots on I should have kicked him."
</p>

<p>
Tony shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Reggie," he said, "I know very little
more about Musette than you do.  I met her
exactly two months ago in the Bois, when, in her
extremely sensible way, she stopped and asked me
to get rid of some futile Frenchman who had been
following her round for the best part of an hour."
</p>

<p>
"How charming!" said Reggie.  "That sort of
thing never happens to me.  Did you hurt him?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he shuddered a little at my accent,"
replied Tony.  "Anyhow, he cleared out, and I
took Musette back to the Hotel de Paris, where
she was staying.  There I met Mrs. Watson, and
they asked me to call on them in London."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds like Phillips Oppenheim at his best,"
said Reggie.  "But surely you must have found
out something more since then.  What relation is
she to the old lady, and where does the girl get
her money from?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I've no idea," he said.  "She has never offered
to tell me anything, and so, of course, I've never
asked her.  We've just been pals&mdash;that's all."
</p>

<p>
Reggie helped himself to a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't live in Curzon Street on
nothing," he said.  "I've tried it.  They must
have at least five thousand a year.  I think you
will have to marry her, Tony, and trust to luck."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed a little uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she wouldn't marry me," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Any woman would marry you if you asked her
nicely.  You have got such an alluring voice."
</p>

<p>
Tony suddenly straightened himself.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not going to marry Musette," he
said.  "It would be a damned shame."  Then he
walked across the room and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
Reggie said nothing.  With his head on one
side he smoked away thoughtfully at his cigarette.
</p>

<p>
The silence was broken by the entrance of Ropes.
</p>

<p>
"Is the car round?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
"It has been outside exactly twenty minutes,
sir," replied Ropes equably.  "I have put in the
luncheon basket and three bottles of champagne.
Everything is quite ready, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good," said Tony, picking up two or three
stray sovereigns from the dressing-table.  "I will
now put on my coat, Ropes."
</p>

<p>
The impassive man-servant stepped out into the
hall, reappearing a moment later with a magnificent
astrachan-lined garment, in which Tony proceeded
to envelop himself.
</p>

<p>
"If any one should call, sir?" asked Ropes
interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
Tony picked up his cap.
</p>

<p>
"Tell them," he said, "that it is more blessed to
give than to receive."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," replied Ropes gravely.
</p>

<p>
Three minutes afterwards, with Tony at the
wheel and Reggie reclining luxuriously in the
beautiful limousine body, the big Rolls-Royce
drew noiselessly away down Piccadilly.
Whatever Tony's shortcomings might be, he could
certainly drive a car.  Threading his way through
the traffic with a very poetry of judgment, he
glided round the corner of Park Lane, and, cutting
across the bows of an onrushing motor omnibus,
disappeared in the direction of Curzon Street
before the indignant brake-grabbing driver of the
latter could recall a single adequate word.
</p>

<p>
In front of a small, recently painted house he
brought the big six-cylinder to a standstill.  Then
he turned round.
</p>

<p>
"I'll ring," he said.  "Don't you trouble to get
out."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't going to," replied Reggie pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, there was no necessity for
the exertion, for just as Tony was preparing to
disembark, the door of the house opened, and a
tall, pleasant-looking girl, neatly dressed in blue
serge, stepped out on to the pavement.
</p>

<p>
Tony jumped down and took off his cap, while
Reggie gracefully rose and imitated his example.
</p>

<p>
The girl smiled gravely.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid you must have had a bad night,"
she said; "you are only twenty minutes late."
</p>

<p>
"Mine is the hand that dragged him from his
lair, Miss Gilbert," said Reggie languidly.  "But
for me he would still be in his bath."
</p>

<p>
The girl looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"That was very kind of you, Mr. Seton," she
said gently.  "I have heard you are rather an
expert at getting out of hot water yourself."
</p>

<p>
Tony chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Musette!" he said.  "Right on the
point.  If you want to follow it up, say you are
going to ride inside."
</p>

<p>
Musette's eyes twinkled.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course!" she said.  "Where else
should I sit?"
</p>

<p>
Reggie, who was still standing, looked at her
appealingly.
</p>

<p>
"You have driven with Tony before," he said,
"and you know the risks you are running.  Death
is much easier on the box-seat.  Besides, I want
to hold Gwendoline's hand."
</p>

<p>
"I am not at all sure that it is respectable," said
Musette severely.
</p>

<p>
"It will only be her left hand," pleaded Reggie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, in that case," said Musette; and,
without further objection, she seated herself
alongside of Tony.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes' flirtation with death brought the
car to Portman Mansions, where Gwendoline, a
charming blend of Dresden china and Paquin,
floated delicately into the limousine.
</p>

<p>
Then away past Euston and King's Cross, up
through the sordid dreariness of Pentonville and
so out on to the far-flung Broxbourne road.
</p>

<p>
Once clear of the general traffic, Tony began to
enjoy himself.  Over the first ten police-ridden
miles the big car glided along at a steady twenty-five,
and then, as the houses became fewer, and the
green fields began to appear on either side of the
road, the index finger on the speedometer crept
encouragingly up.
</p>

<p>
Musette, who seemed to be blessed with
delightfully steady nerves, watched him with frank
interest.  She made no attempt to talk, such
conversation as there was being almost wholly
confined to spirited comments from Tony on the
extraordinary prevalence of deaf and lame
pedestrians.  Indeed, his only departure from this
interesting monologue was an occasional hurried
request to Musette to "Give 'em the Gabriel," a
presentation which she effected with promptness
and efficiency.
</p>

<p>
From the tonneau behind, Reggie, who was
softly stroking Gwendoline's hand, surveyed them
with languid approval.  "I don't suppose," he
said contentedly, "that there are four such
charming people as ourselves in the whole of
England."
</p>

<p>
Gwendoline looked a little doubtful.
</p>

<p>
"I think Musette is very nice," she said, "but I
don't quite understand her."
</p>

<p>
"You should never understand any one," replied
Reggie.  "It's like knowing the answer to a
riddle."
</p>

<p>
"Does Tony love her?" asked Gwendoline.
</p>

<p>
Reggie thought for a moment,
</p>

<p>
"I'm inclined to think it's more serious than
that," he said.  "I have an idea that he likes her."
</p>

<p>
Gwendoline wrinkled up her forehead.
</p>

<p>
"I can't love any one I don't like," she said
decisively.  "I've tried several times, and it's
always been a failure."
</p>

<p>
"I can," observed Reggie frankly.  "I love lots
of people, but I don't think I like any one very
much except you and Tony, and Martin, my valet.
If you all died, I should become what my uncle
calls 'a slave to passion.'"
</p>

<p>
"It sounds rather nice," said Gwendoline.
</p>

<p>
Reggie sighed.  "It's dreadfully expensive,"
he observed.
</p>

<p>
Except for a slight misunderstanding with a
farm cart on the borders of Cambridgeshire, which
Tony patched up with a charming apology and a
sovereign, no untoward incident marred the
remainder of the drive.  Half-past one was just
striking as the car entered the outskirts of
Newmarket.  Through the broad, grey main street,
with its stray race-horses and its lounging throng
of gaitered, clean-shaven men, Tony steered a
sober and considerate course.  The town was full
of visitors, and almost every other man who passed
either touched his cap or waved a cheery greeting.
</p>

<p>
Musette smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be the best-known person in London,
Tony," she said.
</p>

<p>
"To the police," said Tony modestly, "I believe I am."
</p>

<p>
A swift run up the hill, a sharp turn to the right,
and the Heath, fresh and green in the crisp October
air, stretched out gloriously before them.  Tony
brought the car to a standstill just beyond the
enclosure, and then, leaning over, affectionately
patted the dashboard.
</p>

<p>
"Good girl!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Musette nodded.
</p>

<p>
"She has done splendidly.  You must give her
a nice helping of oil while I get lunch ready."
</p>

<p>
The latter operation did not take long.  A
well-meant offer of assistance from Reggie and
Gwendoline was firmly, if politely, declined, and by the
time Tony had attended to the car's requirements,
a pleasing medley of champagne, lobster mayonnaise,
cold tongue, and Madeira jelly was set out
invitingly on the portable table inside the body.
</p>

<p>
"Here," said Reggie, raising his glass and leaning
back luxuriously, "is the health of the gentleman
who invented that charming phrase, 'the idle
rich.'"
</p>

<p>
"You might have drunk mine first," protested
Gwendoline, "after holding my hand the whole
way down."
</p>

<p>
"Reggie," said Tony, "has the most perfect
manner and the most imperfect manners of
anybody I know.  Musette, your health!"
</p>

<p>
Musette bowed gravely.
</p>

<p>
"My toast," she said, "is that you may all back
the winner."
</p>

<p>
"Tony," said Reggie, "has backed Little Eva.
I think I shall do the same.  The liftman told me
that she was 'very 'ot.'"
</p>

<p>
"Is that what they call 'a tip?'" asked Gwendoline,
wrinkling her forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, child," said Reggie, patting her hand.
"Such expressions are not seemly for a young girl
to use."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, dear," said Gwendoline, "but you
might put ten bob on for me.  I want some new
gloves badly.  You have nearly worn out this pair."
</p>

<p>
"I can't be left out," said Musette, producing
her purse.  "Tony, you look honest.  Here's a
sovereign for Little Eva."
</p>

<p>
Tony took the coin.
</p>

<p>
"I'll hedge against you all," he said.  "It may
bring me luck."
</p>

<p>
"Well, here goes my last fiver," said Reggie,
with a sigh.  "If Little Eva's beaten I shall dine
with you all in turn next week."
</p>

<p>
"Have we time for a quarter of a cigarette?"
asked Gwendoline.  "I feel the gambler's tremors
coming on.  Look at my hand.  It's shaking like
a leaf."
</p>

<p>
"A white rose petal," said Reggie gallantly,
"would be a more accurate simile.  Have one of
mine.  They're Russian, and not paid for."
</p>

<p>
Gwendoline helped herself delicately.
</p>

<p>
"Reggie," she said, "never pays for anything;
he thinks it's vulgar."
</p>

<p>
"It certainly isn't common," observed Tony.
"Reggie carries it to extremes, however.  I
remember his tailor once saying to him with tears in
his voice, 'Ah, Mr. Seton, I shall either have to
give you up or else take my lad away from Harrow.
I can't afford the two.'"
</p>

<p>
"And which did he do?" asked Gwendoline
puffing out a little cloud of smoke.
</p>

<p>
Tony waved his hand towards Reggie's perfect
frock-coat.
</p>

<p>
"There," he said, "is the answer."
</p>

<p>
Gwendoline shook her head sadly.
</p>

<p>
"I have always thought," she said, "that there
was some dark secret in Reggie's life.  Hallo,
there's a bell.  Let's put away these things and go
and see what's happening."
</p>

<p>
Between them, Tony and Musette quickly
packed up the <i>dÃ©bris</i> of luncheon, and then, leaving
the car in charge of a courteous, if somewhat
heavily suborned, policeman, they all four made
their way into the enclosure.
</p>

<p>
As is usually the case on Cambridgeshire day,
the Heath was packed in a manner which must
have been highly gratifying to the directors of the
race-course.  On the further side of the track the
spectators stretched away down to the bushes in a
long continuous line, while both the stands and
the enclosure were as full of people as such superior
and expensive places could rightly expect to be.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the first two races were over, there
came a rush for the paddock, where the
Cambridgeshire horses were being saddled.
</p>

<p>
"I vote we stop where we are," said Tony,
turning to the others.  "What does any one say?"
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please, as far as I'm concerned,"
said Reggie.  "I like to have a look at the runners,
but I'm always ready to be unselfish."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Reggie," he said, "if it wasn't for the
tail you wouldn't know one end of a horse from the
other."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," admitted Reggie calmly; "but
I like to walk round and say that so-and-so looks a
bit fine-drawn, and thingumybob a bit tucked up.
It's wonderful how people always agree with you."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't," said Gwendoline, with decision.
"I never agree with you, Reggie, except when you
tell me I'm beautiful."
</p>

<p>
Tony raised his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Don't quarrel, children," he said, "until after
the race is over.  I shall break down if you do."
</p>

<p>
"Here they come!" cried Reggie, as the small
group of men clustered round the entrance to the
paddock suddenly scattered to right and left.
"Look out for Little Eva."
</p>

<p>
A handsome chestnut, his coat gleaming like
new bronze in the mellow afternoon sunlight, was
the first to appear.  He came out sideways,
prancing and shaking his head, and then, twisting
round, galloped up past the stands, sending the
earth flying beneath his heels.
</p>

<p>
"That's Colchester, number twelve on the
menu," said Tony.  "He's the only one I'm afraid
of."
</p>

<p>
"Let's hope he'll break his neck," said Reggie
piously.  "Here are the others."
</p>

<p>
One after another the fifteen runners cantered
down the course, being greeted with successive
cheers that swelled or sunk according to their
position in the betting.  The loudest welcome of
all was reserved for the last, a beautiful, shapely
black, carrying the famous Rothschild colours.
</p>

<p>
Tony moistened his lips.  "There she goes," he
said quietly.  "Pretty mare, isn't she?"
</p>

<p>
No one answered; only Musette was looking at
him.  The others were gazing down the course
after the horses.
</p>

<p>
From the stands the start was plainly visible.
One could see the tall posts of the gate, and the
various runners fidgeting about like small black
dots.  For about five minutes the movement
continued, while a silent tension gradually spread
throughout the thousands of watching figures.
</p>

<p>
The sharp ting of a bell, a sudden gasping cry,
"They're off!" and everyone was leaning forward,
staring eagerly towards the broken line that rolled
unsteadily up the course.
</p>

<p>
On they came, while louder and ever louder the
vast volume of voices swelled into a frenzied roar
of excitement.
</p>

<p>
"The Dryad wins!" "Colchester!  Colchester!"
"Little Eva for a hundred!" "The
Dryad!  The Dryad!"
</p>

<p>
Neck and neck in the centre of the course three
horses were sweeping along, clear by a couple of
lengths from the parti-coloured medley behind.
A hundred yards from home and they were still
level, the gap behind them widening at every
stride.  Suddenly one of them faltered.  A sudden
shout, "The Dryad's beat!" burst from a thousand
throats, and the next moment, locked in an
apparently inseparable stride, Colchester and Little
Eva came thundering past the post.
</p>

<p>
The wild cheering died down into a brief spell of
almost intolerable silence.  Every eye was glued
to the tall frame, waiting the fateful decision.
</p>

<p>
With a perfectly steady hand Tony lit a cigarette.
"Colchester's won," he said quietly.  "A
short head, I should think."
</p>

<p>
The words had hardly left his lips when a hoarse
roar proclaimed the hoisting of the numbers.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  12<br />
  &nbsp;6<br />
  &nbsp;9<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tony laughed lightly.  "I thought so," he
said.  "Reggie, you've lost your fiver.  Let us
hope it will teach you not to gamble."
</p>

<p>
But for once in a way Reggie had no answer.
He was staring down the course, biting jerkingly
at an unlit cigarette.
</p>

<p>
It was Gwendoline who broke the silence.
"Poor Reggie," she said.  "I can't let you starve.
You must come and dine with us."
</p>

<p>
Tony thrust his hand into his pocket, and pulled
out Reggie's five-pound note.
</p>

<p>
"Musette," he observed, "there is still corn in
Egypt.  What about the Savoy?"
</p>

<p>
Musette, who had been looking at him with
rather troubled eyes, shook her head and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"No, Tony," she said; "I should be haunted by
Mr. Seton's ghost.  You must dine with me at
Curzon Street."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it would be more decent," said Tony.
"After all, Reggie was a friend of mine before he
went under.  I'll send the fiver to the
Anti-Socialist fund."
</p>

<p>
Reggie, who seemed to have recovered himself,
turned round with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Yours is a callous heart, Tony," he said.
"Suppose we leave this scene of vice and get back
to town.  There's sure to be a poisonous crush
after the last race."
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready," replied Musette.
</p>

<p>
"So am I," added Gwendoline, "unless Tony
wants to stay."
</p>

<p>
Tony buttoned his coat.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Delmar's interest in racing," he observed,
"is temporarily suspended."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was just six o'clock when the big dust-stained
car pulled up outside Portman Mansions.  Reggie
opened the door, and Gwendoline, after collecting
her various possessions, rustled daintily out.
</p>

<p>
"Eight o'clock, Reggie," she said, "and there's
a woodcock for dinner.  Don't be late.  Good-bye,
Miss Gilbert.  Good-bye, Tony; I'm frightfully
sorry Little Eva lost."
</p>

<p>
"Your griefs are mine, Gwendoline," observed
Tony gravely.  "Where do you want to get out,
Reggie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, drop Miss Gilbert next," said Reggie.
"I'll come along with you to Hyde Court."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes brought them to Curzon Street,
where Musette alighted.
</p>

<p>
"Eight o'clock also, Tony," she said; "but I'm
afraid there's no woodcock.  It will be an
impromptu feast."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not greedy," said Tony.  "It is one of my
few good points."
</p>

<p>
Reggie climbed into the vacant seat alongside of
him, and, waving farewell to Musette, they slid
off noiselessly round the corner.  Neither of them
spoke until the car drew up outside Tony's flat.
Then Reggie laid his hand on his friend's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be stupid, Tony," he said.  "Marry
Musette.  You'll make her very happy."
</p>

<p>
Tony remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Reggie, with a sigh; "it's not
my business.  There is only one other thing I
want to say.  As far as it goes, Tony, you know
that what's mine is yours.  You'll let me do what
I can?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Reggie," said Tony, "there's only
one luxury I can afford to carry away from this
absurd city, and that's the thought that there was
one person I never borrowed any money from.
Still, it's quite charming of you, Reggie.  Come
and have breakfast with me in the morning."
</p>

<p>
Reggie nodded.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the car in charge of the porter on duty,
Tony climbed a little wearily up the stairs that led
to his flat.  As he opened the door he was met in
the hall by the impassive Ropes.  Tony looked at
him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"I see from your expression, Ropes," he said,
"that you have been reading the evening paper."
</p>

<p>
Ropes inclined his head.
</p>

<p>
"If you will pardon me, sir," he observed, "I
was deeply distressed to see that Little Eva had
lost, very deeply distressed."
</p>

<p>
Tony took off his coat and hat, and handed them
over to his sorrowing retainer.
</p>

<p>
"Ah well, Ropes," he remarked, "we've had a
pleasant time while it lasted.  You must go to
Lord North; he's been pestering me to give you up
for years.  You'll have a bigger scope there for
your peculiar abilities."
</p>

<p>
Ropes shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be sorry to disappoint his lordship, sir,
but it would be impossible for me to accept another
place.  If you can no longer retain my services, I
shall retire."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are very rich, Ropes?" said
Tony sadly.
</p>

<p>
Ropes bowed.  "Quite comfortably off, thank
you, sir.  I trust, sir, that, if you will excuse my
mentioning such a matter, the question of wages
will not lead you to dismiss me before it is quite
convenient.  I should be deeply distressed if you
allowed such a consideration to influence you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You shall at least have the felicity of helping
me dress for dinner, Ropes," said Tony gravely.
"We will discuss these unpleasantly sordid topics
to-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later a taxi pulled up outside
Musette's house in Curzon Street, and Tony,
faultlessly accoutred, stepped out.  He was shown
into a room on the left of the hall, where Musette,
gracefully slender in a dark blue evening frock, was
sitting back in an easy chair, turning over the
pages of a novel.
</p>

<p>
"It will be a duet," she said, holding out her
hand, which Tony kissed; "poor Aunt Jemima is
in bed with a headache."
</p>

<p>
"A day of disasters," observed Tony.  "I felt
it when I got up this morning."
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and a neatly dressed parlour-maid
announced dinner.
</p>

<p>
Musette laid down her novel and, rising from
her chair, accepted his arm.
</p>

<p>
"We'll hope, at all events," she said, "that the
food will be an exception."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the hall to the dining-room, where
a small round table, bright with silver and glasses,
stood out attractively against the black oak panelling
of the walls.  The only light came from four
red-shaded candles in the centre.
</p>

<p>
Musette's "impromptu feast" turned out to be
a dainty little dinner which would have won the
approval of Colonel Newnham Davis.  Some
excellent soup was followed by grilled sole,
sweetbreads, and a partridge, the whole concluding with
an alluring symphony on toast in which eggs and
old Madeira supplied the leading motif.  Assisted
by a bottle of Lafitte, and a couple of glasses of
"Bristol cream," Tony's immediate troubles faded
luxuriously from his memory.  He possessed to a
supreme degree that enviable gift of living in the
present, and as he chatted away cheerfully to
Musette, the thought that on the morrow he would
be facing an unsympathetic world without a penny
in his pocket never once intruded its unpleasant
image.
</p>

<p>
It was only in the small room afterwards, when
he was sitting over the fire smoking a cigar and
watching the light flickering softly on Musette's
white arms, that the sudden realization of his
position gripped him.  With a horrible abruptness
it occurred to him that this was probably the last
time he would see her.  Up till that moment he
had never thought about his relations with
Musette.  Without making love to her he had drifted
into a kind of charming intimacy, quite different
from anything he had previously known in a fairly
extensive experience.  Now the thought that he
was going to lose her appeared to him suddenly in
all its naked simplicity.  He stared into the fire,
trying to grasp the unpleasant revelation.
</p>

<p>
Musette leaned forward, looking up at him.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Tony?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Her hand was on the arm of the chair, and Tony,
almost unconsciously, laid his own on it.  Her
soft and cool clasp answered him with a little
affectionate pressure.
</p>

<p>
"My poor Tony," she said, "you look as worried
as Saul.  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
The devil, or whoever is responsible for our
temptations, suddenly brought up in Tony's mind
the recollection of Reggie's parting words.  He
looked down longingly into Musette's upturned
face.  Here in this strange gracious girl lay a
wonderful escape from the black morass into which he
had stumbled.  She met his gaze with steady,
wide-opened eyes and a rather troubled smile.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Tony dear?" she repeated.  "Tell
me."
</p>

<p>
He slowly moved his hand until it imprisoned
her arm, and then bent down towards her.
</p>

<p>
"Musette," he whispered, "Musette."
</p>

<p>
Her breast rose and fell like some beautiful
white flower, but she remained silent and motionless.
Tony was so near now that he could feel the
warm breath from her parted lips, and for a
moment he forgot everything in the supreme hunger
to kiss her.  It was as he did so that his conscience
suddenly broke through the habits of a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
He stood up quietly in front of her and put his
hands behind his back.
</p>

<p>
"I was going to ask you to marry me, Musette,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Musette nodded.
</p>

<p>
"But now," said Tony, after a short pause, "I
am going to tell you the truth instead."  He sat
down and stared into the fire.  "I'm ruined,
Musette.  I owe about ten thousand pounds, and
I haven't a penny in the world.  I've spent and
gambled away every shilling my father left me.
I had the last five thousand I can possibly raise on
Little Eva."
</p>

<p>
Musette, who had been listening to him with the
same half-grave, half-smiling expression on her
face, got up from her chair and crossed the room
to a small satin-wood writing-table in the corner.
She opened the drawer and took out something.
</p>

<p>
"Is this your cheque, Tony?" she asked, handing
him a small slip of pink paper.
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at it in bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," he said.
</p>

<p>
Musette sat down and folded her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Murray brought it to me, instead of paying it
into the bank.  I thought if you asked me to
marry you I'd give it you back as a good-bye
present."  She paused.  "As you haven't done so,
Tony," she added, "I think I shall have to cash it."
</p>

<p>
Tony dropped the cheque on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," he repeated helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"My father's real name," said Musette, "was
Morris."
</p>

<p>
Tony stared at her.
</p>

<p>
"Morris," he repeated mechanically.
</p>

<p>
Musette smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he liked to think it was Morris," she
added.  "I believe, as a strict matter of fact, that
it was originally Moses.  At least, mother always
said so.  Anyhow, he was a very good father.  He
left me his business, Tony, and Murray to help me
look after it."
</p>

<p>
Tony jumped up from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scot!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
Musette shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"No, Tony," she said.  "He's a Jew, too, only,
like father, he's ashamed of it.  I'm the only one
in the firm with any honest British blood.  At
least, I believe mother came from Dublin.  She
was never quite sure about it."
</p>

<p>
Tony said nothing; he only stared at her.
</p>

<p>
"It brings me in about nine thousand a year,"
added Musette, with reflective inconsequence;
"so it would be a pity to drop it, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
There was a silence, lasting for about a minute.
Then Tony came over to Musette, and stood looking
down into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Musette," he said simply.  "I am
several kinds of a blackguard, and I don't think
it's very probable that we shall ever see each other
again, but at all events I didn't ask you to marry
me."
</p>

<p>
Musette smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I think, Tony," she said, "that you are the
only man who has ever paid me a compliment
that I care about."
</p>

<p>
Then, as Tony turned to go, she got up from her
chair and stood in front of him, with her hands
behind her back.
</p>

<p>
"And I am sure, Tony," she added calmly,
"that you are the only man I know who would
never bore me."
</p>

<p>
For a second Tony hesitated.  Then, taking her
by the shoulders, cool, fragrant, and smiling, he
drew her into his arms.
</p>

<p>
And on this occasion Tony's conscience seemed
quite satisfied.

<h3>
"Squarky-woo"
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Once upon a time there was a little mouse called
Squarky-woo, who lived behind the wainscoting
in a house in Berkeley Square.  His mother, who
lived with him, was very old, and very grey, and
very wise.  He called her Mammy-ana, partly
from affection and partly because it was her name.
She was a widow, Squarky-woo's father having
met with a tabby catastrophe in the kitchen, which
had abruptly terminated his stainless career in the
very flower of mousehood.  It had been a cruel
blow to Mammy-ana, who had loved him dearly,
and would not have lost him for all the cheese in
Cheddar.  She had dragged his remains from the
dust-heap on to which they had been thrown, and
lovingly interred them beneath the dining-room
floor, erecting over his grave the simple and
touching memorial:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  REQUIESCAT<br />
  IN<br />
  PUSSIE<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From that day onward she had lavished the
whole affection of her broken heart upon little
Squarky-woo.  He was indeed a mouse of which
any mother might have been proud.  His coat was
as brown as the Thames water at London Bridge,
his eyes were as black as Maria, and his teeth were
as sharp as needles and as white as ivory.  Deep
down in her heart Mammy-ana thought him perfect,
but it must not be supposed from this that
she in any way neglected her duties as a mother.
She insisted on his getting up at twelve o'clock
every night, and going into his hole at six o'clock
every morning.  He was never allowed to play
with the other young mice, or to use any vulgar
expressions, such as "Go to Felis!" or "You be
trapped!"  Above all, he was strictly forbidden,
on any excuse whatever, to go near the kitchen in
which his beloved father had met so dreadful
a fate.
</p>

<p>
With the foolishness of youth, Squarky-woo
chafed under this admirable discipline.  Not that
he ever complained to his mother&mdash;oh, dear, no!
He loved her too much, and, besides, she would
probably have beaten him.  Of course, if she had
done so, it would only have been for his own good;
but Squarky-woo, being modest by nature, felt
that he was quite good enough.  So he kept his
thoughts to himself, and did what he was told, and
Mammy-ana frequently informed him that he was
the best behaved and the most satisfactory little
mouse in the whole of Berkeley Square.  "This,"
she would add, "is rather due to your excellent
upbringing than to any innate virtue that you
yourself possess."  And Squarky-woo, who had
quite made up his mind to pay a visit to the
kitchen on the first possible occasion, used to bow
his head gracefully, as though recognising the
truth of her remark, and then wink at himself in
the looking-glass under the dining-room sideboard.
</p>

<p>
Though nothing can excuse such duplicity,
especially in early life, Squarky-woo's conduct
was not really quite so reprehensible as it appears
at first sight.  He suffered from temptations of
which Mammy-ana was ignorant, for the other
young mice had the most offensive habit of jeering
at him whenever she was not present.  "Yah!"
they would cry, "Who's afraid of the cat?  Look
at little Stay-in-hole!"  Then they would tell him
wonderful stories about the kitchen, how the floor
was strewn with crumbs, and how exciting it was
to creep in quietly and pick them up, while the
great, ugly brute of a cat nodded away sleepily in
front of the fire.  And Squarky-woo would grind
his teeth with impotent fury, and swear to himself
that, come what might, nothing should stop him
from sharing in their adventures.
</p>

<p>
And so, one evening, when Mammy-ana had
gone across the square to pay a visit of congratulation
(the cat at No. 4 having been rather severely
bitten by a stray dog), Squarky-woo seized the
opportunity of putting his long-cherished scheme
into operation.  He waited until twelve o'clock,
when all the half-dressed people upstairs seemed
to have gone to bed, and then, creeping softly out
of his hole, made his way to the head of the kitchen
stairs.  His heart was beating furiously with
excitement, and that strange, delicious ecstasy
which, alas! so frequently accompanies a first
departure from the paths of right flowed fiercely
through his veins.  He listened for a moment or
two, scarcely daring to breathe, but the quivering
of his own tail alone broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
Very cautiously he crept downstairs, until he
reached the basement, where a small, blue jet of
gas was flickering feebly in the draught.
Squarky-woo knew from this that the servants had all
retired into their holes.  He paused for a moment
outside the pantry door, until he heard the butler
growling through his nose, which, according to
Mammy-ana, was a sure sign that he had gone to
sleep.  Then, setting his teeth, he scuttled off
down the passage in the direction of the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
To his intense surprise, the door was partly
open; some careless scullery-maid had evidently
forgotten her duty.  For one instant he hesitated
as the memory of his father's fate suddenly rushed
into his mind.  But the thought of what the other
young mice would say swept away all caution, and,
trembling with excitement, he crawled forward,
and peeped round the corner into the forbidden
chamber.  In his wildest moments he had never
imagined anything so exquisite.  His heart almost
stopped beating, and, in a hoarse whisper, he
ejaculated to himself the single exclamation,
"Crumbs!"  The floor was literally strewn with
them.  Bread, toast, flour, bacon, potato&mdash;minute
portions of all that made life sweet and radiant lay
scattered there in boundless plenty.  The dying
firelight shone upon the silver covers on the walls,
and threw a faint, harmonious glow over the entire
banquet.
</p>

<p>
Tears of happiness gathered in Squarky-woo's
eyes, and rolled gently down his nose.  No wonder
his father had risked everything in such a cause.
Instead of a rash, indefinite shadow, Squarky-woo
suddenly saw him in the guise of an heroic martyr,
and a great thrill of family pride shot through his
fluttering heart.  He raised his head, and glanced
savagely round the kitchen.  Where was that
infernal cat?  She should pay bitterly for her deed
of blood.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, however, for Squarky-woo, the cat
was otherwise engaged, and with the exception of a
few black beetles, who eyed him with apathetic
interest, he was in sole possession of the kitchen.
Well! vengeance would keep, and the crumbs
would not.  There they lay in all their toothsome
beauty.  He crushed back his more noble sentiments,
and flung himself upon the feast.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those rare occasions when the
realization of a long-cherished scheme is even more
enjoyable than imagination has already painted it,
and so eagerly did Squarky-woo enter upon his
task that for some moments he was totally oblivious
of all other considerations.  At length, however,
when the first glow of gratified appetite was
gradually cooling down, he began to realise that
the whole apartment was permeated by a delicate
perfume for which none of the fragments on the
floor were directly responsible.  He stopped eating
and began to sniff the air with the rich satisfaction
of a true connoisseur.  "If that isn't Cheddar
cheese," he murmured to himself, "I'm a Dutch-mouse!"
</p>

<p>
As far as he could judge, the source of this
delicious odour lay somewhere in the direction of
the fireplace.  In eager expectancy he darted
across the floor; and there, just in front of the grate
lay the most perfect slice of Cheddar cheese,
surrounded by a curious arrangement of wire and
wood.
</p>

<p>
Now Squarky-woo had been brought up by
Mammy-ana on an excellent principle, carefully
copied from the manner in which she had observed
human beings educated their children.  That
such things as traps and cats existed it was, of
course, impossible to deny, but what they were
like in appearance, and where they were likely to
be found, were things that no decent-minded
young mouse had any right to know.  The great
object of education was to launch one's children
upon the world in absolute ignorance of the darker
side of life.
</p>

<p>
"My own little Squarky-woo," she would say to
other approving mothers, "is just as pure-minded
as the day that he was born."
</p>

<p>
This being so, Squarky-woo had naturally no
idea that the curious thing in front of him was a
trap.  He had often heard other young mice speak
of such things with bated breath, but had never
dared to ask what they were actually like, for fear
that he should be laughed at for not knowing.  So
he walked round it, and sniffed at it, and puzzled
his head trying to make out what it was.  It could
scarcely be intended to keep the cheese clean; it
was obviously not intended to prevent anybody
stealing it.  Well, it was no good trying to account
for human idiocy.  People who kept cats for
pleasure were obviously a little wanting in ordinary
intelligence.  If they chose to put their cheese
into a sort of birdcage and leave it on the kitchen
floor, that was their own look-out.  He knew what
to do with it if they hadn't.
</p>

<p>
Hesitating no longer, he ran into the trap, and,
catching hold of the corner of the cheese with his
sharp little teeth, gave it a quick jerk in order to
detach it from the hook.  Snap!  He leaped
round like a flash, but it was too late&mdash;<i>the door of
the trap had closed behind him</i>.  For an instant
he scarcely realised what had happened; and then
the hideous truth suddenly broke upon him in all
its terrible reality.  He hurled himself recklessly
against the wires, but the cunning artificers of
Birmingham had wrought them of the stoutest
copper, and he only bruised his tender little body,
and made no impression upon his prison.  In
pitiful distress he turned round and round, seeking
in vain for some outlet.  There was none; and
Squarky-woo realized that nothing was now left to
him except to face a cruel and painful death
without disgracing his lineage.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Mammy-ana had returned from her
visit in excellent spirits, the cat at No. 4 having
been even more badly bitten than rumour had
related.  So it had been in a very genial frame of
mind she had run upstairs, laughing gaily to herself
as she pictured the amusing incident.  Her only
regret was that she had not been present to listen
to the cat's squeak.  That would have been music
indeed.
</p>

<p>
Before going out, she had told Squarky-woo that
he had better not leave the hole until her return,
so she was very surprised, and not a little annoyed,
to find that he had disobeyed her.  "However,"
she thought, "he is probably only in the dining-room
or the drawing-room, and I can't really be
angry on such an auspicious occasion."
</p>

<p>
She trotted off to look for him, still chuckling to
herself, and no suspicion of the terrible truth
entered into her mind.  Indeed, it was not until
she had thoroughly searched both apartments that
she began to get a little uneasy.  "Surely Squarky-woo
could not have been so madly disobedient as to
go down into the kitchen!"  She inquired of one
or two mice she happened to meet, but none of
them had seen anything of her son; and one of
them went so far as to remark that he thought she
always carried him in her pocket.  But Mammy-ana
was in no mood for joking.  A horrible fear
was slowly tightening round her heart.  She darted
away to the head of the kitchen stairs, and peering
down into the dimly-lit passage, called out
nervously:
</p>

<p>
"Squarky-woo! are you there?"
</p>

<p>
A faint answering squeak echoed up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Come up at once," she cried.
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause, and then a feeble broken
little sob: "Caught in a trap."
</p>

<p>
The world seemed suddenly to reel round before
Mammy-ana's eyes, and it was only with a
super-verminous effort that she stopped herself from
fainting.  Sick with dread, she hurried downstairs,
and, guided by the sound of Squarky-woo's
voice, made her way straight to the kitchen.  At
the sight of her darling caught fast in the hideous
engine of destruction, the last remnant of hope
fled despairingly from her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Squarky-woo," she cried, "oh, you little
fool!" and great tears of misery almost blinded
her.
</p>

<p>
Squarky-woo crushed back his sobs when he saw
his mother weeping.
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry, Mammy-ana," he said, "I am not
worth it.  I am only a wicked, ungrateful little
beast, and I don't mind dying."
</p>

<p>
Then Mammy-ana broke down helplessly and
sobbed out that he was all she had in the world,
and that it was all her own fault for not having told
him what a trap was like, and that Heaven knew
she had done it all for the best.  A sad, twisted
little smile flickered across Squarky-woo's face,
but he only shook his head and repeated bravely:
</p>

<p>
"No, mother, it was all my fault."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she cried, "I might have known what
would happen.  Your father's blood was bound to
come out."
</p>

<p>
Squarky-woo's eyes lit up with a great pride.
"Yes," he said, "it has taught me how to make
a fool of myself, but it will also teach me how
to die."
</p>

<p>
"Listen," cried Mammy-ana suddenly.  "There
is one faint chance.  If the cat is not present when
you are discovered, they will try to drown you.
Just as they are going to open the trap I will
attract their attention, and if by any chance they
open it a second too soon&mdash;jump, darling, jump,
for your life and mine."
</p>

<p>
A glimmer of hope stole into Squarky-woo's
eyes, and he set his little teeth with a grim
determination that was good to witness.  Mammy-ana
wiped away her tears, and kissed him through the
wires.  And when the cold, grey light of morning
crept through the chinks in the shuttered windows,
she was still beside him, softly encouraging him
with words of hope, and firmly resolved that if she
failed to save him it should be at the price of her
own existence.
</p>

<p>
At last a heavy step outside warned them of
approaching danger, and Mammy-ana scuttled
away and took up her position under the dresser.
The terrible and immediate necessity for caution
kept her cool and alert, though every nerve was
tingling with savage determination.  Then the
door opened, and a great, sleepy scullery-maid
blundered into the room.  Directly she saw
Squarky-woo in the trap she gave a scream of
terror, and darted to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Cook, cook," she called.  "Come 'ere."
</p>

<p>
Mammy-ana heard the door of the cook's room
open, and the angry answer that came across the
passage:
</p>

<p>
"Well, what are yer screechin' about, silly?"
</p>

<p>
"There's a mouse in the trap."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it won't eat yer."
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of flopping footsteps, and the
cook waddled in, looking anything but pleasant.
</p>

<p>
"Never 'eard such a noise," she remarked
angrily.  "Ain't yer ever seen a mouse before,
fat'ead?"
</p>

<p>
She advanced towards the fireplace, and glanced
down at Squarky-woo.  "Where's that blessed
cat?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Dunno," said the scullery-maid.
</p>

<p>
"What's the good of you?" demanded the cook
scornfully.
</p>

<p>
Being apparently unable to find any satisfactory
solution to this problem, the scullery-maid only
glanced nervously at Squarky-woo and murmured,
"Pore little thing."
</p>

<p>
"Pore little thing!" shouted the cook indignantly;
"p'r'aps ye'd like to make a pet of it.
'Ere, there's Jaimes.  Jaimes!  Jaimes!"
</p>

<p>
The footman&mdash;a tall, pale-faced young man&mdash;sauntered
in in a state of some incompleteness with
regard to costume.
</p>

<p>
"What are you 'ollerin' about?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"You might tike and drown this 'ere mouse like
a good feller," said the cook.
</p>

<p>
"Mouse," he echoed sarcastically.  "Lor' bless
us! it might 'a bin a tiger from the row you was
makin'."
</p>

<p>
He picked up the trap with a brutal indifference
and strolled towards the door.  Trembling with
excitement, Mammy-ana slipped along the wall
after him.  He strode down the passage whistling
to himself, and, turning the corner, came to a
standstill just alongside of a large tin bucket full of
water.  "Let's see yer swim," he remarked to
Squarky-woo, and, lifting the trap, placed his
thumb upon the spring.  With a prayer in her
heart, Mammy-ana leapt forward and struck in
with her sharp little teeth upon the calf of his leg,
which was only protected by a thin white stocking.
With an exclamation of pain he started back, and
unconsciously pressed the spring.  Up went the
flap, and out went Squarky-woo, just missing the
bucket by the eighth of an inch.  He came down with
a terrible bang upon the stone floor, but was up
again in an instant, and, before the astonished
footman had recovered his composure, both he
and Mammy-ana had disappeared down a
neighbouring hole.
</p>

<p>
"'Ave you drowned it?" called out the cook.
</p>

<p>
And James, who knew women, pulled himself
together and said, "Yes."
</p>

<p>
Upstairs, in Mammy-ana's quiet little retreat,
the final and distressing <i>dÃ©nouement</i> took place.
Squarky-woo crouched in a corner awaiting his
destiny.  For some time Mammy-ana eyed him in
stern silence.  Then she flicked her tail and
Squarky-woo shivered.
</p>

<p>
"Come here," she said.
</p>

<p>
He made no motion.
</p>

<p>
"Come here," she squeaked, "you&mdash;you&mdash;wee,
slickit, cowering, timorous beastie!"
</p>

<p>
Horrified at her language, Squarky-woo turned
to escape, but it was too late.  With one bound
Mammy-ana was upon him, and catching hold of
his ear with her teeth, she lifted up his tail, and
beat him with her own.

<h3>
With the Conquering Turkey
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I had just finished breakfast, and was slowly
enjoying an especially fragrant pipe, when my
front-door bell rang with some violence.
</p>

<p>
"This is undoubtedly Pitman," I said to myself.
</p>

<p>
It was.  He came in stamping the snow off his
boots on to my new carpet.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," I said harshly.  He seated himself
obediently, and tearing off the front page of the
<i>News and Leader</i>, which had been left at my house
by mistake, I handed it across to him.
</p>

<p>
"Put your feet on that," I said, "if they'll go on,
and don't move until they are properly thawed,
and whatever you do, don't remark it's seasonable
weather."
</p>

<p>
He followed my instructions meekly.
</p>

<p>
Pitman is a great friend of mine.  We live in the
same village, and he is a local architect.  At least,
that is what he calls himself.  Some of his clients
call him other things.  He is also married.
</p>

<p>
I am rather frightened of Mrs. Pitman, for she is
under the impression that I exercise an evil
influence over her husband.  She told another lady
in confidence, who repeated it to me, that "no
man would live in a country village by himself
unless he had something to hide."
</p>

<p>
I tossed my tobacco pouch across the table.
</p>

<p>
"Light a pipe and explain yourself," I said.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you would be in bed and asleep," he
began.  "You're getting into vicious habits living
alone.  When an unmarried man takes to breakfasting
at nine o'clock it's a bad sign&mdash;shows he
can't sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Pitman," I said pathetically, "you have not
come out half a mile on a snowy morning to try
and be funny.  Out with it."
</p>

<p>
"Have you got any whisky?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I thought there was some good reason.  There
it is behind you.  Aren't you allowed to have it at
home?"
</p>

<p>
"Not before lunch, and quite right, too; but
that isn't the real reason why I came."
</p>

<p>
"Have a cigar?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied.  "I came to give you some
information.  You are coming up to town with me
by the four o'clock train."
</p>

<p>
"What are we going for?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"We are going to buy a turkey," he said
quietly.
</p>

<p>
I looked at him in amazement.  "Going to buy
a turkey!  Why, you can get a much better one
here."
</p>

<p>
He smiled.  "Much better, but my wife thinks
otherwise.  You see, she was brought up in
London, and she is still under the impression that you
can get nothing fit to eat outside.  She made up
her mind long ago to buy the Christmas turkey in
town, and she was going up to-day to choose one.
However, this morning the infant suddenly
developed a pain in its tummy, and she decided
she couldn't leave it.  So I volunteered, and was
accepted."
</p>

<p>
"And you want an expert opinion?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  I know a turkey when I see one all
right.  I want your society.  We'll dine somewhere
and do a music-hall and come back by the
last train."
</p>

<p>
"But I never heard such nonsense," I objected.
"Trotting all round London to buy a turkey!
It's ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
"Naturally," said Pitman calmly, "or my wife
wouldn't have suggested it."
</p>

<p>
"I will think it over," I said.
</p>

<p>
Pitman took out his watch.  "I shall call for you
at three-thirty.  That will give you six hours to
get ready."
</p>

<p>
"I dislike being hurried," I said irritably.
</p>

<p>
"We shall dine at the Piccadilly," he went on,
"and I shall pay for dinner."
</p>

<p>
"That settles it.  If you had said so sooner we
should have been saved all this superfluous
conversation."
</p>

<p>
Pitman got up slowly and walked towards the
door.
</p>

<p>
"You will take particular notice," he observed,
"that I said <i>dinner</i>.  There was no mention of
drinks."
</p>

<p>
"I was hoping it was an oversight."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "I am fond of you, Victor,
but I have a sense of duty towards my family."
</p>

<p>
Then, as Mr. Hall Caine would say, he went out
into the snow.
</p>

<p>
He turned up again at a quarter to four in a fur
coat, with a large basket in his hand.
</p>

<p>
I looked at him in stern disapproval.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not come with you," I said, "unless
you dress yourself decently and leave the basket
behind.  I hate walking about with people who
carry baskets."
</p>

<p>
"I don't," he said, "so you shall carry it."
</p>

<p>
"May I ask if you wish to lug the turkey about
London?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I don't wish to," he replied, "but the wife&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I cut him short.  "In that case you have no
choice.  Did she also insist on the fur coat?"
</p>

<p>
"That was my own idea," he replied proudly.  "I
have had it for two years, and only worn it once."
</p>

<p>
"What happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  It was in my room in front of the
looking-glass."
</p>

<p>
"People will think I am your dresser," I objected.
</p>

<p>
"They will respect you as an artist," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"We won't argue the point," I said.  "Wait
till dinner-time; then you will be sorry you insulted me."
</p>

<p>
We arrived at Waterloo at a quarter to five, by
which time Pitman had reached a state of intense
irritation.  The carriage had been full the whole
way, and its other occupants had done little but
cast furtive glances of admiration and envy at his
coat.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven we're out of that," he muttered,
as he stepped on to the platform.  "Gaping set of
idiots!"
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing to what you're going through," I
replied encouragingly.  "I warned you before we
started.  What's the programme now?"
</p>

<p>
"Short's first," he said, "and then the turkey.
I can't do it in cold blood."
</p>

<p>
We found a cab and drove across Waterloo
Bridge, pulling up at Mr. Short's eminent tavern.
Pitman said his nerves were out of order, and
suggested champagne.  I hate arguing.
</p>

<p>
"That's something rather hot in the way of
coats," said the barmaid pleasantly, as she snipped
the wire.
</p>

<p>
Pitman was positively rude.
</p>

<p>
"You must excuse my friend," I put in, trying
to smooth matters down.  "We are just going to
pawn it, and he is rather sensitive on the subject."
</p>

<p>
She smiled complacently.  "I wish you meant
it," she said, and with this cryptic remark she left
us to attend to another gentleman.  Pitman
turned to me.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he began warmly, "I'm not going
to be made a target for your silly wit."
</p>

<p>
"It was the best I could think of," I protested.
</p>

<p>
He drank up the champagne, and became a
little more cheerful.
</p>

<p>
"Those people in the train upset me," he
explained.  "Come along; we'll go and buy the
turkey now."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Smithfield Market."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to make a hit there," I said hopefully.
</p>

<p>
He glanced down at the coat with a nervous
hunted sort of expression.  "I wish I hadn't
brought the thing," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Wait till we get to Smithfield," I returned,
"you'll wish it much more then.  They're a nice,
genial, outspoken set of people at Smithfield."
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, our reception was distinctly
disappointing.  But for a few encouraging cries
such as: "Yar!  Look at the bloomin' millionaire!"
"When did yer git it aht, guv'nor?"
"Chuck us a quid, Rothschild!" our entrance
into the market passed off without any special
demonstration.
</p>

<p>
Pitman was distinctly hard to please.  We
wandered about from stall to stall, and at last
drew up opposite one where a large gentleman with
a face like a blood orange was vociferously presiding.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere y'are, sir," he called out.  "The finest
birds in London."  Then, glancing at my friend's
coat, "Nothing but the best for you, sir.  'Ere's
the werry thing."  And he held out the most
magnificent turkey I have ever seen in my life.
</p>

<p>
Pitman, who is a bit of an artist, was at once
taken with its beautiful plumage.
</p>

<p>
"That's a lovely bird," he exclaimed, turning to me.
</p>

<p>
"Better ask a few questions," I suggested in a
whisper, "or he'll take you for a mug and
overcharge you."
</p>

<p>
Pitman turned to the salesman.  "How old is
it?" he demanded suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't got 'is birf stifficut," replied the latter
affably; "but 'e ain't come of age yet."
</p>

<p>
"Where was it brought up?" pursued Pitman.
</p>

<p>
The fat man preserved his composure.
</p>

<p>
"Hoxford College," he replied, winking at me.
</p>

<p>
"Is it an early riser?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, Victor," said Pitman.  "How much?"
he asked, addressing the salesman.
</p>

<p>
"Let yer 'ave it for thirty bob, sir.  Twenty
pahnd turkey for thirty bob!"
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," said Pitman, handing across
the basket.  "Put it in here."
</p>

<p>
"Now we'll go and have another bottle of fizz,"
I remarked, as we turned away from the stall.
</p>

<p>
Pitman nodded his head.  "The cold weather
makes one frightfully thirsty, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nearly as bad as the hot," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"We must be careful not to have too much,"
said Pitman.
</p>

<p>
"Drinking," I observed, as I led the way into
a cheerful-looking tavern, "is no longer a mere
physical indulgence.  By legislation we have
turned it into an art."
</p>

<p>
"And the policemen are the critics," added
Pitman.
</p>

<p>
I looked at him approvingly, and ordered
another bottle of "Mumm."
</p>

<p>
All the better side of Pitman's nature steals out
under the influence of champagne.  As a rule, he is
inclined to be taciturn and a trifle selfish.  Touched
by the garment of Bacchus, rare and unexpected
qualities develop with amazing rapidity.  In the
present instance he became almost morbidly
tender-hearted.
</p>

<p>
"We'll take a four-wheeler to the Piccadilly,"
he said, finishing his glass.
</p>

<p>
"Why not a taxi?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head mournfully.  "Don't want to
jog the turkey."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," I objected.
</p>

<p>
"It's not nonsense," he retorted.  "How would
you like to be shut up in a bag?"
</p>

<p>
It was obviously no use arguing, so I gave in.
Going outside, we summoned a seedy-looking
growler and plodded off towards the restaurant.
Pitman took the turkey out of the bag and placed
it on the seat opposite us.
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful bird," he said thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Magnificent," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
Then he lay back and went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
I woke him up when the cab stopped.  "Come
along," I said; "here we are.  You sling on to the
turkey.  I'll pay the man."
</p>

<p>
I followed him into the hall, and found him
standing there with the basket under one arm and
the turkey under the other.
</p>

<p>
"Put those things in the cloak-room," I whispered
hurriedly.  "Everyone is laughing at you."
</p>

<p>
"Let 'em laugh," he replied, looking round
defiantly.  "You 'member what Sol-Solomon says
about thorns under a pot.  The turkey's coming
in to dinner with me."
</p>

<p>
"Pitman," I said, "I'm ashamed of you."
</p>

<p>
He walked up to the cloak-room, and deposited
his coat, hat, and stick.  Then he put the turkey
into the basket.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I take that, sir?" inquired the attendant.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Pitman haughtily; "leave him alone."
</p>

<p>
"That will be all right," I interposed, giving the
man a shilling.  I was curious to see what would
happen.
</p>

<p>
Pitman marched downstairs to the grill-room,
carrying the basket.  The place was crowded.
</p>

<p>
"I want a table for three," he said to the waiter.
</p>

<p>
The latter looked at him curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I take that outside, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Pitman drew himself up.  "Don't you dare to
touch him."
</p>

<p>
We were beginning to attract attention, so I
settled the matter by leading the way across the
room to the further corner, where there was an
empty table.  We sat down, and, taking the turkey
out of the basket, Pitman proceeded to prop it
up in the vacant chair, to the intense interest and
joy of the people at the surrounding tables.  The
waiter whose duty it was to attend to us entered
into the spirit of the joke, his sense of humour
being probably quickened by a prophetic instinct
with regard to our financial value.
</p>

<p>
"Dinner for three, sir?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
Pitman examined the menu with some deliberation,
and settled upon a satisfactory little
programme.  He is acquainted with my weaknesses.
</p>

<p>
"My other friend," he said, pointing to the
turkey, "will begin with a little thick soup."
</p>

<p>
At this point the manager of the restaurant
arrived.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, sir, but I'm afraid I must
request you to remove that bird," he began in a
firm but apologetic tone.  "The other ladies and
gentlemen, you know, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
This put Pitman on his dignity.
</p>

<p>
"If they object to my friends I will leave the
restaurant," he replied.
</p>

<p>
A genial-looking man at the next table here
joined in the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I for one," he said, "am delighted to be in such
interesting society."
</p>

<p>
"You hear that!" cried Pitman triumphantly.
"Go away, manager.  No, stop a minute; have a
drink?"
</p>

<p>
The manager shook his head.  "Thank you
very much, sir; but I'm afraid it would be against
my rules.  Of course, if the other guests don't
object to the bird I have nothing further to say."  He
shrugged his shoulders and walked away.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget that dinner.  Under the
influence of a third bottle of champagne Pitman
became magnificent.  His brilliant conversation
was distributed impartially between me and the
turkey and the people at the neighbouring tables,
all of whom were intensely sympathetic.  It would
be useless to attempt to describe it, and to tell the
truth, I myself have a very imperfect idea as to
what actually occurred.  I distinctly remember,
however, that about nine o'clock I suggested the
Hippodrome.
</p>

<p>
At first Pitman was obstinate.  He declared
that it was not a nice place to take the turkey to,
but after a good deal of persuasion I managed to
overcome his scruples, and amidst a chorus of good
wishes we left the restaurant.
</p>

<p>
By the aid of a taxi we arrived at the Hippodrome
without difficulty.  I took the turkey, and
sent Pitman to buy the tickets.  He returned just
as I was trying to smuggle the bird into the
cloak-room.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think you're doing?" he demanded
indignantly.  "I've got a stall for him."
</p>

<p>
"A stall!" I echoed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a stall.  Don't be selfish."
</p>

<p>
I gave it up, and followed him meekly into the
hall.
</p>

<p>
I have a curiously indistinct recollection of
what occurred subsequently.  I remember being
remonstrated with by a large gentleman in uniform
to whom Pitman explained the situation with some
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Constable," he said; "it's all right, constable.
Promised my wife not to let the bird out of my
sight.  Got a stall for him&mdash;he won't make any
noise.  Well-behaved bird, sergeant; brought up
at Oxford.  That's all right, off'cer."
</p>

<p>
Whether it was this lucid explanation, or the
half-crown with which he substantiated it, that
brought the attendant to reason I do not know, but
without any more opposition we took our seats
triumphantly in the centre of the front row.
</p>

<p>
It was a cheerful, Christmassy sort of audience,
and the turkey made an instantaneous hit.
Indeed, it attracted far more attention than the
performance.  Pitman insisted on buying it a
whisky-and-soda, and got quite angry when it
refused to drink.  It sat up rakishly with a cigar
in its claw, while he talked to it seriously about the
sin of ingratitude.  At last one of the performers
refused to go on unless we were removed.
</p>

<p>
With an injured air, Pitman tucked the turkey
under his arm, and we left the house amidst ringing
cheers from the gallery.
</p>

<p>
By this time it was nearly ten o'clock, and as our
last train left London at ten-thirty, we drove off
to Waterloo without any further delay.  When
we arrived at the station Pitman insisted on buying
three tickets.  He declared, with tears in his
eyes, that nothing would induce him to cheat the
railway company; I suggested that he might put
the turkey back into the basket, but he shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"Promisht the wife not to squash it," he said
thickly.  "Wouldn't have me break my promish?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied sadly.  "Get in."
</p>

<p>
We entered the carriage, and Pitman sat the
turkey up in the further corner.  Then we both
went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
I woke with a start just as the train was beginning
to throb its way out of the station.  Glancing
carelessly through the window, I saw, to my
amazement, that we had arrived at our destination.
I flung open the door and dug Pitman in
the ribs.
</p>

<p>
"Come along," I yelled.  "Here we are!"
</p>

<p>
He scrambled out after me on to the platform,
and the train glided away into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
We were both of us rather upset, and Pitman
decided that he would come to my house and have
a brandy-and-soda before going home.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing like brandy-and-soda for a nervous
shock," he said gravely.
</p>

<p>
I felt a little doubtful about the brandy, but he
seemed so certain that I gave way, and we trudged
up together to the cottage.  I lighted the lamp in
my little dining-room, and poured out a couple of
drinks.
</p>

<p>
"Pitman," I said, "we've had a ripping day."
</p>

<p>
"Ripping," he repeated.
</p>

<p>
I raised my glass.  "Here's luck," I said, "and
long life to the turkey."
</p>

<p>
With a cry of horror Pitman dropped his tumbler
and collapsed into a chair.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Then the hideous truth dawned upon me.
</p>

<p>
We had left the turkey in the train.

The Later Edition
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
George Barton pushed open the swinging
doors, and came into the bank.  Several people
were standing at the counter&mdash;a couple of tradesmen,
an old lady, an errand boy&mdash;while the cashier,
an elderly, harassed-looking man, was counting
over a large heap of silver, which one of the former
had just paid in.  He looked up as Barton entered,
and nodded in the direction of the other customers.
Barton lifted the slab that led through into the
office, and walking up to a side door with a
frosted-glass panel, opened it, and hung up his hat upon a
peg inside.  Then he came to the counter, and
began to attend to the people who were waiting.
His work was characterized by a mechanical
swiftness noticeably absent in the movements of his
elderly <i>confrÃ¨re</i>; so by the time that the latter had
satisfied himself that the pile of silver in front of
him corresponded with the amount on the slip,
Barton had settled the requirements of the remaining
customers.  The cashier made an entry in his
"scroll," filled the credit slip, and then, after
carefully wiping his pen and laying it on the desk,
turned to Barton.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to lunch now," he said.  "If you
have time, you might put a few of these entries
through"&mdash;he pointed to a twisted-up heap of
cheques and credit slips under a paper-weight.
"We have been rather busy while you were out,"
he added.
</p>

<p>
"All right," answered Barton, without looking
up from the book in which he was writing.
</p>

<p>
For the next quarter of an hour the bank was
practically deserted; the silence only being broken
by the scratching of pens, or an occasional sigh
from one of the two junior clerks, who were
working at a desk behind.  Outside, the world was
bathed in the golden sunshine of a perfect June
day; but within, it was merely another hot
afternoon dragging on its ordinary monotonous round.
Barton soon entered up the pile of arrears
bequeathed him by his companion, and added up the
latter's scroll for him.  One of the senior clerks
came in from the manager's room with a pile of
papers, threw them down on the desk, and
sauntered up to where he was working.
</p>

<p>
"How goes it?" asked the new-comer, taking out
a pen-knife and beginning to clean his nails.
</p>

<p>
"All through, up to date," said Barton.  "Do
you want to get out early?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I do rather, if you can manage it."  He
glanced over the scrolls.  "I see you have been
giving Weary Willy a hand."
</p>

<p>
Barton smiled.  "You would be here till six if I
didn't.  It is quite time the poor old chap got his
pension."
</p>

<p>
"They ought to make you cashier," said the
other.  "Furze wants to go at the end of the year,
if they will let him.  Why don't you apply for it?"
</p>

<p>
Barton glanced round to see if they were overheard,
and, speaking in a lower voice, answered,
"That is just what I did last week.  The manager&mdash;he
is a little brick, Blackmore&mdash;sent up a very
strong letter urging my fitness, and all that sort of
thing; but the directors wrote back and said I was
too young.  Rather sickening, wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you go in for something else?"
asked his companion.  "With your brains you are
wasted in a bank.  Any fool can do this sort of
thing."
</p>

<p>
Barton flushed slightly.  He was twenty-one,
and the compliment was obviously genuine.  "It
is all very well, Steele," he said; "but what can I
do?  I haven't got a halfpenny in the world, and I
have had to keep myself ever since I entered this
confounded hole.  I shan't stay in it a minute
longer than I can help, but at present&mdash;" he
shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"It is a bit off, isn't it?" agreed Steele
sympathetically.  "I should leave myself, if I could do
anything else.  By the way, do you want a tip for
the Manchester Cup?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's curious!" said Barton.  "You are
the second to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Second what?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I have just had a letter from a man
offering to give me a tip.  What's yours?"
</p>

<p>
"'Kildonen.'  It's a dead cert.  What's yours?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know till this evening.  The whole
thing is rather quaint.  The other night I was
coming down Shaftesbury Avenue very late, when
I saw a fellow being set on by two or three
rough-looking brutes, so I ran across to lend him a hand.
He was very grateful, and turned out to be McFadden,
the tipster&mdash;you know, the chap who is always
advertising in the sporting papers.  Well, he
insisted on taking my name and address, and this
morning I got a letter from him asking me to dine
at the Troc.  He said he could put me on to a good
thing for the Manchester Cup."
</p>

<p>
"You back 'Kildonen,'" said Steele sceptically.
"I got it straight from my brother, who is a pal of
the trainer.  Ten to one McFadden will put you
on to some rotter."
</p>

<p>
"We shall see," answered Barton, getting up
to attend to a customer who had just come in.
"At all events, I will let you know what he says."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Barton lit his cigar and, leaning back in his
comfortable seat, looked round the big restaurant
with a quiet satisfaction born of an excellent
dinner, a bottle of good champagne, and a really
first-class Larranaga.  Barton's companion, a big,
sun-burnt man, with a large moustache, twinkling
black eyes, and a face heavily pitted with the
remnants of smallpox, waited until the men serving
liqueurs and coffee had moved on to the next
table, and then resumed the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't want those chaps to get hold of what I
was saying," he explained; "they know me, and it
would be all over London to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Barton leaned slightly across the table towards
him, and lowering his voice, McFadden continued:
"It's the chance of a lifetime.  Not a soul
witnessed the trial except Rainsford and Burch, and
you can trust them to keep it dark.  They want
the money; besides, Rainsford is the sort of man
who would cut his throat rather than give away a
tip; and I know Burch has told no one but myself.
Even Relf, the jockey, thinks that he was carrying
about ten pounds less than he was; so you can take
it from me that, with the exception of us four, there
isn't a living soul who has an idea of what 'Mountain
Lady' can do.  She will start at twenty to one,
and unless she is left at the post or drops dead on
the course, nothing will get near her.  Why, just
think, man, according to the trial, that would put
'Night-jar' in at about eight stone four; while, as a
matter of fact, he would be carrying nine stone,
and then be a hot favourite.  You must have
something on&mdash;something worth winning.  If you
can beg or borrow 'a monkey' for a couple of days
you are made for life.  I could get it on for you
with Cook at twenty to one, but he would want to
see the cash first, and I have none to spare at
present, or I would do it for you.  It means simply
picking up ten thousand.  I am sticking on every
penny I can spare myself.  We shall have to back
to win, for there won't be more than six runners
but it's as safe as the Bank of England."  His face
was flushed with excitement as he finished.  Picking
up his glass of liqueur, he drained it at a gulp.
</p>

<p>
Barton had listened intently; his eyes had never
left McFadden's face, and he felt sure that the
man had been telling him what he at all events
believed to be the truth.  "It is very kind of you
to have given me the tip," he said, "and such an
excellent dinner into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
"Bosh!" returned the other shortly.  "Waiter! two
more liqueur brandies.  Look here, youngster,
you acted like a gentleman the other night&mdash;got me
out of a damned tight place&mdash;and I never forget a pal."
</p>

<p>
Barton was silent for a moment.  "What about
'Kildonen'?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
McFadden laughed.  "Oh, I know the stable
are sweet on him, but he hasn't a dog's chance
against 'Mountain Lady' at the weights.  Besides,
he is a clumsy, bad-tempered brute at the best of
times.  What I have told you is gospel truth,
sonny; and if you like to send me anything to
Morley's Hotel, I'll shove it on for you.  Of course
do the business yourself if you prefer it; but, in
case you wanted a big deal, I thought you might
have some trouble in getting it on&mdash;see?"
</p>

<p>
Barton's face was, perhaps, a little paler than
usual, but, beyond that, there was no trace of any
particular emotion in his appearance or manner to
betray the sudden thought that had flashed across
his mind while McFadden was speaking.  He
sipped the second liqueur which the waiter had
just put down in front of him, knocked the ash off
his cigar, and then, leaning across the table again
towards his companion, answered quietly: "I
believe what you tell me, and I am very grateful
to you for letting me know.  It is just possible I
might be able to borrow a few hundreds; but I
should have to spin some other yarn about it.
Now, if I were to send you something in notes first
post Friday morning, could you let me have them
back, if all goes well, on Friday night?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course!  Cook will pay up Saturday.
As long as he knows the cash is there, he wouldn't
want it till after the race, even if we were to go
down.  There is nothing dead certain, but this is
just as near to it as you can get.  It's worth
risking something, or I wouldn't put you on to it.  I
have been messing about with the turf for twenty
years, and it's the best thing I ever struck."  He
took out his watch, and looked at the time.  "I
must be off," he added; "I have to meet a man at
half-past.  You think it over, and do just what
you like; only don't talk about it."
</p>

<p>
He paid the bill, tipping the waiter generously,
and they walked upstairs.  At the door he turned
to Barton.  "I have dealt with you straight," he
said; "you did me a good turn, and I always pay
my debts when I can."
</p>

<p>
Barton nodded, and held out his hand.  "If I
can raise the money, I will ask you to put it on for
me.  In any case&mdash;thank you."
</p>

<p>
Through the warm starlit night Barton walked
home to his rooms in Bloomsbury.  His face was
pale and drawn, and he walked fast, staring
straight in front of him.  A fierce excitement was
tingling in his blood; his brain and conscience
seemed to be dancing together in a mad riot of
contradictions.  Through it all McFadden's words
leaped out in letters of fire: "It means simply
picking up ten thousand."  He kept on repeating the
sentence to himself.  Ten thousand pounds!  Was
there anything impossible in the world with such
a sum?  A hundred paths, leading up the hills of
power and fame, opened out suddenly before his
chained ambition.  He walked on quickly,
unsteadily, his hands clenched, his eyes shining.
</p>

<p>
He turned into Burton Crescent, and stopped
before a dark, untidy-looking house that stared
forlornly on the ill-kept square in front.  He had
lived here for the last two years, a small bedroom
on the third floor being the exact amount of luxury
permitted him by his salary.  The hall was in
total blackness&mdash;no reckless jet of blue wasted on
the hall burners in Burton Crescent&mdash;but experience
had taught Barton to dispense with such
facilities.  He made his way upstairs, stumbling
over a sleeping cat, that fled away into the darkness
with a horrible scream.  His room was poorly
furnished, but saved from the usual deadly
barrenness of such apartments by two large shelves
crowded with books, a fine engraving of
Burne-Jones's "King Cophetua," and one or two cheaper
reproductions of well-known pictures.  He locked
the door behind him, and turned up the gas.
</p>

<p>
He began to feel a little more collected.  This
excitement was contemptible&mdash;the wine must have
gone to his head.  He poured himself out a glass
of water, and drank it off.  The thing had to be
faced here and now, in all its radiant possibilities,
in all its cold reality.  He sat down in the frayed
arm-chair and filled his pipe with trembling fingers.
McFadden had spoken the truth, of that he felt
certain.  The man might have been deceived, but
Barton doubted it.  He was no callow novice at
the game to suck in an ordinary turf lie with such
conviction.  Besides, he had hinted that Burch
had reasons for not deceiving him.  Then there
was the chance that the trainer himself had been
mistaken; such a thing might happen, and, as
McFadden himself had said, nothing was certain,
the mare might be left at the post.  He lit his
pipe and began to smoke quickly, trying to see the
thing in its right proportions.  On the one hand,
years of drudgery at the bank, mean sordid poverty,
surroundings such as these&mdash;he looked round
and shuddered&mdash;to lead to what?  Who could tell?
He knew that he had ability, but life was such a
ghastly lottery.  Handicapped as he was, without
money or friends, what more likely than that he
should share the fate of others, fully as able and
ambitious as himself&mdash;men who had eaten out their
hearts in the labour and disappointment of existence,
while life floated past on golden wings mocking
and out of reach?  And on the other hand, a
deliberate crime, a temporary theft; and then,
either life itself, full-blooded, working, joyous life,
with success and fame to light the road, or&mdash;he
paused a moment&mdash;death.  There was no other
alternative.
</p>

<p>
He got up and crossed the room to the battered
deal dressing-table.  Pulling open the drawer, he
took out a small revolver, almost the sole legacy of
his father, a cashiered major in the Army.  Well,
why not?  His life was his own, there was no one
dependent on him, no one who would ever regret
his death, except, perhaps, the fellows at the
office.  If he chose to cast it into the scale against
destiny, who had the right to question him?
</p>

<p>
He put back the revolver and paced slowly up
and down the room.  It would be so easy in his
position at the bank.  He had a perfectly free
access to the cash, and was himself responsible for
what he used at the counter.  It was checked
sometimes by the manager, but never on Friday or
Saturday; on those days Blackmore went away
early to play golf.  He could take five hundred
pounds on Thursday night, and, if he won, replace
the same notes on Saturday morning.  If he lost&mdash;well,
there would be a headline for the papers, and
another vacancy for a head clerk in the bank.  It
was stealing, of course; sophistry had no place in
his mental equipment.  Up till now he had never
done a dishonourable action.  The terrible example
of his father, and an instinctive dislike to
anything underhand, had kept him straight.  For a
moment he hesitated&mdash;then suddenly some words
he had read in a book a few evenings before flashed
into his mind.  He repeated them with a sort of
desperate mockery:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He either fears his fate too much,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or his deserts are small,<br />
  Who dare not put it to the touch,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win or lose it all.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Yes&mdash;Yes.  That was best.  "To win or lose
it all."  He whispered the last line over again;
and knew that he had decided.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"You have made a mistake," said Steele, "and
you will know it in another twenty minutes.  Did
you put much on?"
</p>

<p>
Barton smiled.  "Not enough to get excited
about."
</p>

<p>
"I stuck a quid on 'Kildonen,' so I shall be a bit
sick if he goes down."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's a good deal to lose," said Barton
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"I have to go around now to see Johnstone and
Driver for Blackmore.  I shall be back in about
half an hour, and I will bring a paper in with me.
You will be sorry you did not take my tip when you
see the result&mdash;'Kildonen' first, 'Mountain Lady'
nowhere.  Lucky for you you didn't plunge."
</p>

<p>
"It would have been rather foolish, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"You look a bit off colour to-day, somehow,"
said Steele, tying up some deeds which he was
taking to the lawyers.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't sleep much last night.  I expect I
want my holiday."
</p>

<p>
"Like the rest of us.  Two weeks in the year are
no good to any one.  Well, so long!  Prepare for a
disappointment when you see the paper."
</p>

<p>
"I am quite ready," answered Barton.
</p>

<p>
His fellow clerk laughed, and picking up his
parcel of deeds, passed out of the office.  As the
swing-door closed behind him, Barton suddenly
realized that they might never meet again.  Steele
had been one of his few friends&mdash;a pleasant
good-natured fellow, who had always treated him with a
faint touch of deference; an unconscious tribute
that some young men are always ready to pay to
a stronger or keener intelligence than their own.
Steele would be sorry if things went wrong.  He
was, perhaps, the only one who would think of
him in future with anything but contempt.
</p>

<p>
Three o'clock!  Another twenty minutes.  They
were in the paddock now.  Relf would be examining
his saddle.  He could picture the scene; the
crush round the favourite.  No doubt "Mountain
Lady"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Some customers came in, and he got up to attend
to them mechanically, adding up the amounts, or
paying out what was required, without the least
hesitation or inaccuracy.  He was scarcely
conscious of what he was doing; it was like a strange
dream.  He felt as if he was looking on at the
tragedy of his own life.  How long had it been?
Twenty-two hours!  He laughed to himself.  What
fool invented the clock?  Last night alone had been
a lifetime.  There had been no time to-day.  It had
drifted past in a dull trance.  After hours of torture
he had waked to a state of mental exhaustion, in
which thought at last was numbed and powerless.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes more!  A tradesman was talking
to him about the weather, as he examined the
endorsements on the cheques, and counted silver
and gold into little separate piles.  "Yes, it was
beautiful: a regular summer day.  It made one
want to be outside, instead of being stuffed up
in an office.  However, business was business, of
course."  A quarter past.  God&mdash;how the
moments dragged!  They were lining up, perhaps.
They might even have started.  In a quarter of
an hour he might be dead.  How those chattering
fools would start if they knew!
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden lull in the work.  Four or
five customers went out almost together, and for a
little while the office was empty.  A strange
apathy settled down like a mist over Barton's
mind.  It was all over now.  The paper would be
out in a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
He went on writing, slowly, correctly.  He felt
as though he were being stifled.  Suddenly, in the
distance, he heard the shrill cry of a paper boy:
"Winner, paiper; Cup winner!"  Something
seemed to snap in his brain.  A deadly calm
succeeded the formless emotions that had been
racking him.  He laid down his pen, and getting up
from his seat, walked to the cashier's desk.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going out for a moment, Mr. Furze," he said.
</p>

<p>
The cashier nodded.  "Don't be longer than
you can help.  We shall be busy again in a
minute."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be back almost immediately," answered
Barton.
</p>

<p>
By the time he reached the street, the boy was
quite close, a ragged little urchin, darting from
one side of the road to the other in pursuit of
customers.  Barton held up his hand, and the boy
rushed across to him.
</p>

<p>
"Paiper, sir; winner, sir!"  He held one out
and Barton took it, giving him a shilling.
</p>

<p>
"You can keep the change," he said.
</p>

<p>
With a quick "Thankee, sir," the lad ran on.
Barton stepped back to the wall and opened the
paper.  In the blank space reserved for stop-press
news was the single word "<i>Kildonen</i>."  It was in
blue ink, stamped in by a local agent.  Barton
stared at it for a moment, and then laughed.  So
he had lost.  He felt no particular emotion&mdash;just
a vague disappointment.  Remorse and fear left
him untouched.  He had played with fate and been
beaten; all that now remained was to pay the price.
</p>

<p>
He crossed the road to a public-house opposite,
and, going into the saloon bar, ordered a glass of
brandy.  A man who was sitting in the corner saw
the newspaper in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"What's won the Cup, guv'nor?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Kildonen,'" answered Barton.  "You can
have the paper if you like.  I have done with
it."  He found himself speaking in a perfectly level,
disinterested voice.
</p>

<p>
Mixing a little water with the brandy, he drank
it off, and walked back to the office.  As he again
crossed the road, a man raced past him on a
motor-bicycle with a huge pile of newspapers strapped
behind him.  The Fleet Street edition was
evidently down now; he could hear the boy's shouting
higher and higher up the road.  He hesitated a
moment; it would be rather interesting to see if
"Mountain Lady" had been in the first three.
Then he shrugged his shoulders, and walked on.
After all, what did it matter?
</p>

<p>
There were no customers in the office.  He
passed through the side door into the small
anteroom where the staff kept their coats and hats.
From here a staircase led down into the strong-room.
He knew that, if he shut the iron door
below, the sound of the shot could scarcely reach
the bank.  It was more pleasant to die without
being interrupted.
</p>

<p>
He walked downstairs quickly, and turned on
the electric light that illuminated the big safe.
Taking out his revolver, he tested the trigger before
putting in a couple of cartridges.
</p>

<p>
Now everything was ready.  There was no
time to lose, for Furze would probably be sending
down for him in a minute.  He felt sorry for the
clerk who would come to fetch him.  He caught
hold of the big, brass handle, and was just
swinging the heavy metal slab into its place, when he
heard the door open and someone running down
the stairs.  For an instant he faltered, and then,
slipping the revolver into his pocket, pushed back
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Barton!  Barton!"  It was Steele's voice.
He rushed into the safe with a paper in his hand.
"Isn't it too rotten?" he exclaimed, flinging it
down on the slab.
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought you would have been
pleased," answered Barton wearily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am glad for your sake, of course; but,
under the circumstances, it's a bit rough on me,
damn it all."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" Barton cried hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you heard?" shouted Steele.  "Kildonen's'
disqualified&mdash;look!"  He thrust the paper
into Barton's hands.
</p>

<p>
With a savage effort the latter choked back a
deadly faintness that almost overpowered him,
and through the dim mist that swam before his
eyes, read the lines that Steele pointed out:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANCHESTER CUP<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KILDONEN 4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain Lady 20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose Crown 7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Charles 11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also ran, Barcup and Flagstaff.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Kildonen" was disqualified for bumping, and
the race awarded to "Mountain Lady."
</p>

<p>
The paper slipped from Barton's fingers.  If
Steele had not caught him he would have fallen
himself.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, old chap?  Are you ill?  I
never thought you would take it like this.  You
hadn't much on, had you?  Let me get you a glass
of water."  The astonished clerk helped Barton
to a stone slab, where he sat for a minute with his
eyes shut.
</p>

<p>
Then he opened them and smiled.  "I am all
right now, Steele.  I&mdash;I have been feeling a bit
ill this afternoon."
</p>

<h3>
The Ordeal by Water
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When I pushed open the door of the restaurant,
the first person I saw was Tommy.  He was
lunching with another man, and, as usual, conversing
with such vigorous cheerfulness that he failed
to notice my arrival.  I walked up to him, and laid
my hand on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Tommy," I said.  "I thought you were
in Timbuctoo."
</p>

<p>
He spun round.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm jiggered!" he cried.  Then, with
that artless directness that so endears him to
strangers, he added impetuously, "What the
dickens are you doing in this God-forsaken place?"
</p>

<p>
An eminent Bristolian at the next table snorted
audibly.
</p>

<p>
"I was just going to ask you the same question,"
I replied, "only in rather more tactful language.
I'm here on business."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," said Tommy, clutching me by the
wrist and dragging me into a vacant chair.  "This
is Mortimer&mdash;Jimmy Mortimer, of the Gold Coast.
We're motoring, and you've got to join us."
</p>

<p>
"May I have some lunch first?" I asked, bowing
politely to Mr. Mortimer.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," said Tommy cheerfully.
"You're feeding with us.  Here, waiter, waiter,
get this gentleman some lunch."
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he added, as the waiter slid off to
fulfil the order, "do you know anything about
salmon fishing?"
</p>

<p>
"In theory," I said, "I know everything.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because as soon as you've finished we're going
to take you up to Hereford, for a couple of days on
the best salmon river in England."
</p>

<p>
I turned to Mortimer.
</p>

<p>
"Much laager," I said, "has made him mad."
</p>

<p>
Tommy chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not joking.  I've got two miles of the
finest private fishing on the Wye from Saturday to
Monday, and a bungalow chucked in."
</p>

<p>
Mortimer nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"That's right," he added.
</p>

<p>
I gazed at Tommy in mingled amazement and
admiration.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Tommy," I said, "no one appreciates
your powers of acquisition more than I do, but
how the devil did you manage it?"
</p>

<p>
Tommy lit a cigar with some contentment.
</p>

<p>
"It was a reward for a kind action," he explained.
"The place belongs to an old boy called Quinn&mdash;Sir
Cuthbert Quinn.  I ran across him last week in
a country lane near Bedford, trying to find out
what was the matter with his car.  He'd been
trying for some time.  Well, I hopped out and put
things straight&mdash;it was only a choked jet, but he
was so grateful that he insisted on my coming
back to lunch with him.  While we were lunching,
we got on the subject of salmon fishing.  I
happened to say how keen I was, and then he trotted
out the fact that he owned an island with a bungalow
on it and two miles of the best fishing above
Symonds Yat.  'Would you like a week-end
there?' he said.  'I should,' said I, 'very much.'  Well,
to cut a long yarn short, he handed me over
the key, and told me I could come up for a couple
of days and bring another rod with me.  I couldn't
think of any one else at the time, so I wired for
Mortimer."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Mortimer drily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as you've got Mortimer," I observed,
"you can't take me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right," put in Mortimer; "I don't
fish.  I've only come for the charm of Tommy's
conversation."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't got a rod," I objected.
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter," said Tommy, "neither
have I.  But there are two up there which old
Quinn said we could use."
</p>

<p>
"How are we going to manage about grub?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Mortimer laughed.
</p>

<p>
"The car's stuffed with it," he said, "especially
drink."
</p>

<p>
That decided me.
</p>

<p>
"I'll come," I said, "but you'll have to call for
my traps.  I'm staying up in Clifton, so it's all on
the way."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" cried Tommy.  "You buck up and
finish your lunch, while we go round to the garage
and get the car."
</p>

<p>
The car, when it arrived, proved to be a 12-14
De Dion which had apparently been a stranger to
the sunny land of France for many strenuous
years.  In colour it had once been green.
</p>

<p>
"Not much to look at," said Tommy apologetically;
"but she goes&mdash;eh, Mortimer?"
</p>

<p>
"She would if I had her," admitted Mortimer,
"for what she'd fetch."
</p>

<p>
Knowing, however, of Tommy's amazing genius
for coaxing motion out of discarded scrap-iron, I
got in behind without a qualm.  With a fanfare on
the horn, we slid out of the garage, and then,
clanking like an ironmonger's shop in an
earthquake, pounded bravely up Park Street at a
surprising velocity.
</p>

<p>
It only took me about five minutes to cast my
week-end trappings into a Gladstone bag and
square accounts with the worthy lady at whose
house I had been staying.  Then off we thundered
again through the peaceful respectabilities of
Clifton and Redland, out on to the far-flung road that
wanders northwards up the Severn Valley.
</p>

<p>
If the Zeitgeist had any particular purpose when
it tossed Tommy's atoms together, it must have
been the production of a super-chauffeur.  Amazingly
erratic as he is in other things, his driving and
handling of a car more nearly approaches
perfection than any human effort I know.  In other
hands the hired wreckage that bore our fortunes
would, I feel sure, have collapsed hopelessly long
before we reached Gloucester.  But Tommy, who,
according to Mortimer, had pored lovingly over it
with a spanner for several hours that morning,
lifted it triumphantly, if complainingly, through
all demands.  At half-past six, dusty and incredibly
vociferous, it clattered into Ross, and, practically
speaking, our journey was accomplished.
</p>

<p>
We had a cup of tea at the hotel there, and then
in the cool of the evening clanked on cheerfully
through the thickly wooded lanes that led to Sir
Cuthbert Quinn's bungalow.  The distance must
have been about six miles, and it was while we were
covering this that we got on to the question of how
great a strain a salmon rod would stand.  Tommy
had been telling us some yarn about how a man he
knew had jerked a fifteen-pound salmon clean out
of the water, and I had ventured to cast a little
mild doubt on the accuracy of the tale.  Tommy
had been quite indignant.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course it's possible," he had declared.
"A salmon rod will stand almost any strain.  The
best swimmer in the world would be quite helpless
if you hooked him by a belt round his middle."
</p>

<p>
"Get out, Tommy," I said derisively; "he'd
break you every time."
</p>

<p>
"I bet you he wouldn't," said Tommy.  "Look
here, you get a good swimmer&mdash;any one you like,
I don't care who he is&mdash;and I'll bet you five pounds
I'll land him in under half an hour."
</p>

<p>
"Done with you," I replied.  "And what's
more, I'll bet you another fiver he breaks your line
inside of five minutes."
</p>

<p>
Mortimer chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"There's money in this," he observed.  "We'd
better advertise it in the <i>Sportsman</i> and charge for
seats.  We might make quite a decent thing out
of it."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke we rattled round the corner of a
deeply embedded lane, and, of a sudden, the Wye
lay before us, gleaming like silver in its cool green
valley.
</p>

<p>
"That's the bungalow," said Tommy, pointing
to a low, red-tiled building which one could just
catch a glimpse of through the trees.  "The
boathouse must be just below us."
</p>

<p>
We trundled delicately down the hill, for the
road rather resembled the traditional highway to
Zion, and pulled up outside a solid-looking
building on the banks of the river.
</p>

<p>
Tommy stopped the engine, and we all clambered
out.  The island lay exactly opposite, its
neatly painted landing-stage facing us across the
water.
</p>

<p>
"Why, there's the boat!" exclaimed Mortimer
suddenly.  "Over there by the steps&mdash;look!"
</p>

<p>
He pointed towards the island, and following his
gesture, we all saw a small dinghy apparently tied
up to one of the willows that fringed the bank.
</p>

<p>
We stared at it in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's funny," I said.  "How did it
get there?  There must be someone on the
island."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said Tommy.  "Why, I had a card
from old stick-in-the-mud only yesterday saying
that it was all clear.  There's probably another
boat of some kind in the shed."
</p>

<p>
He took the key out of his pocket, and thrusting
it into the lock, flung open the door.  The place
was as empty as a barn.
</p>

<p>
Mortimer laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Your aged friend seems to be a bit of a humorist,
Tommy."
</p>

<p>
"There must be someone there," I said.  "Most
likely it's the gardener.  Let's go outside and give
him a hail."
</p>

<p>
We stepped out on to the bank, where Tommy
let off a vigorous yell, while I played an impressive
voluntary on the horn.
</p>

<p>
"That ought to bring him out of his shell,"
observed Mortimer with approval.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, it did nothing of the kind.
The island remained as blissfully untroubled as the
garden of Proserpine.
</p>

<p>
"Try again," suggested Mortimer encouragingly
and we repeated our efforts with the same
result.
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting fed up with this," broke out
Tommy.  "There's only one thing to do, and that's
to swim across and fetch the boat."
</p>

<p>
"What a pity we haven't got a salmon rod," I
remarked.  "We might kill two birds with one
stone."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry," retorted Tommy.  "We'll
try that later."
</p>

<p>
He stripped off his clothes, and going to the edge
of the bank, inspected the water.
</p>

<p>
"Seems clear enough," he observed; "here goes."
</p>

<p>
There was a mighty splash, and he disappeared
from view, emerging a few moments later well out
in the river.  Mortimer and I gave him an
encouraging cheer, and then watched him with some
anxiety as he ploughed his way across the strongly
running current.  It seemed at first as though he
would be swept past the island, but, with a big
effort, he just managed to get clear of the stream
in time and clutch an overhanging bough some
way below the landing-stage.  Then he drew himself
out, and answering our hail with a triumphant
wave of the hand, picked his way gingerly along
the bank to where the boat was tethered.
</p>

<p>
Unhitching the rope, he climbed in, and with a
few strong pulls, sculled back across the river.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Leander!" sung out Mortimer, as the
boat bumped up against the bank.  "How are you
feeling after your great effort?"
</p>

<p>
"Deuced sore," returned Tommy, shipping his
oars and stepping out on to the grass.  "That
seat's as hard as a millstone."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," I said consolingly.  "You'll be
too busy cooking the dinner to want to sit down.
What shall we do with the car?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, run her into the boat-house," said Tommy.
"There's plenty of room there.  And then you
might shove the grub into the boat."
</p>

<p>
Mortimer and I carried out his instructions.
With the expenditure of considerable energy and
language, we trundled that decayed scrap-iron
into the shed, and then began to transfer its
contents to the bottom of the dinghy.
</p>

<p>
By this Tommy had resumed his clothes and
come to our assistance.
</p>

<p>
"I can't make it out, all the same," said Mortimer
reflectively.  "If there's no one on the island,
how the devil did the boat get there?  Old Quinn
must have got off somehow last time he left."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he's a Christian Scientist, and just
wished himself ashore," suggested Tommy.  "Anyhow,
it's no good worrying about miracles.  Catch
on to this, and that's the lot."
</p>

<p>
He pushed over a bulky case of soda-water,
which Mortimer, still frowning thoughtfully to
himself, tucked under one arm, and carrying the
remaining stores between us, we made our way
down to the dinghy.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take the oars," I said; "it's just my distance."
</p>

<p>
"Don't overtire yourself," put in Tommy kindly.
"Remember there's a stiff stream running."
</p>

<p>
"If you find it too much for you," added Mortimer,
"we can always get out and walk."
</p>

<p>
Disregarding such ragged efforts at humour, I
pushed off from the bank; and then, setting a
course well up against the current, slowly tugged
my precious freight over to the island.  With the
true instinct of a waterman, I hit the landing-stage
exactly, in fact, I hit it so hard that Tommy, who
was injudiciously standing up, was as nearly as
possible precipitated into the water.
</p>

<p>
"He thinks it's a bumping race," said Mortimer.
"That's the worst of these 'Varsity men.  Here,
catch hold."
</p>

<p>
He flung the rope to Tommy, who had jumped
out on to the step, and in half a minute the boat
was hitched up tight to a convenient post.
</p>

<p>
Mortimer and I handed out the goods, which
Tommy received and piled up on the shore.  When
we were finally unloaded we also disembarked, and
picking up as much as we could carry, mounted the
wooden steps that led to the front door of the
bungalow.  Tommy inserted the key, and flung it
open.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are," he said.  "Not such a dusty
sort of shanty, is it?"
</p>

<p>
The eulogy was by no means excessive.  Whatever
else Mr. Quinn may have lacked, he certainly
had a nice eye for his surroundings.  The large,
low-ceilinged apartment, with its white walls,
old-fashioned furniture, and big, green-tiled hearth,
combined in the happiest degree the claims of
comfort and good taste.  From the main room a door
on the left led into the kitchen, while at the back
an arched space gave access to a passage from
which the three bedrooms opened off.
</p>

<p>
"What's the programme now?" asked Mortimer.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you chaps feel like," said
Tommy, "but I'm uncommon hungry.  I vote we
start by having some grub right away."
</p>

<p>
Mortimer held up his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Carried unanimously," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Right-ho!" responded Tommy.  "There's a
cold chicken somewhere in the baggage.  You
chaps might unpack while I forage about the
kitchen and get things ready."
</p>

<p>
He disappeared through the door, taking off his
coat, and Mortimer and I set to work upon the
various packages which we had brought with us.
We unearthed an appetising-looking fowl, a ham,
two or three nice crusty loaves, a jar of butter, and
numerous other aids to successful salmon fishing,
including enough beer and whisky to stock a
modest hotel.
</p>

<p>
We were contemplating the latter in a kind of
pleased reverie, when Tommy came back with a
tablecloth under his arm, and a trayload of accessories.
</p>

<p>
"I say," he began, "it's deuced funny, but I
can't find any forks and spoons.  Plenty of glasses
and plates and knives, but not another bally thing
in the place."
</p>

<p>
Mortimer burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"I expect your aged friend eats with his fingers,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Or else someone's been in and cleared the lot,"
I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they can't have done that," said Tommy;
"or else the boat wouldn't be here."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall have to do what we can
without," remarked Mortimer.  "You fellows can
tear off a leg each, and I'll have the pickings."
</p>

<p>
We pulled out a table into the centre of the
room, and while I helped Mortimer arrange the
feast, Tommy went into the kitchen to have
another look for the missing silver.
</p>

<p>
His efforts proved as barren as before, and
finally abandoning the attempt, we settled ourselves
down to do as well as we could with knives
and fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Here's to our week-end," said Tommy, holding
up a glass of Bass.  "And death to the salmon."
</p>

<p>
"Death to the salmon," I repeated hopefully,
raising my glass in turn.
</p>

<p>
We were just drinking the toast, when Mortimer
suddenly sat bolt upright in his chair and
glanced quickly round behind him.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Sh!" he whispered.  "Go on talking loudly.
Don't stop whatever you do."
</p>

<p>
We followed his instructions, watching him with
amazement as he jumped up noiselessly from his
chair, and crept like a cat across the room as far as
the archway.  Here he stopped, bending down and
listening intently, with his hand to his ear.
</p>

<p>
When he turned, his face was alight with excitement.
He came swiftly back, signalling to us to
keep up the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"There's someone getting out of one of the
bedroom windows," he whispered across the table.
"Don't stop talking, but get to the door, and make
a sudden rush for it.  We're bound to catch him."
</p>

<p>
A smile of holy joy irradiated Tommy's countenance.
Next to wrestling with a motor-car, a
physical difference of opinion with a fellow-creature
appeals to him more than anything else in the
world.  He leapt up, and instantly assumed
command.
</p>

<p>
"You and Mortimer take the left; I'll go the
other way.  Buck up, or the blighter will have
scooted."
</p>

<p>
Before he had finished speaking he had reached
the door, clearing the steps with a single jump and
bursting his way through the shrubs like a rather
reckless rhinoceros.
</p>

<p>
Further strategy being apparently out of place,
Mortimer and I followed as rapidly as we could.
Darting up the path that ran round the other side
of the house, we emerged into the clearing behind,
just in time to see an unknown gentleman hurl
himself frantically into the fringe of undergrowth
that lined the opposite bank.
</p>

<p>
In a moment Tommy, who was hard on his heels,
had plunged in after him.  There was a shout, and
then the dull thud of two heavily falling bodies.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," roared Tommy.  "I've got him."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, Mortimer tripped over the root of a
tree and went sprawling full length on the grass.
I did not wait, but leaping over a tangle of
blackberry bush that barred the path, pressed on
gallantly to Tommy's assistance.
</p>

<p>
I found him tied up in an amazing network of
agitated arms and legs.  As far as I could see, the
stranger was underneath, and from the somewhat
unpleasant sounds which were rising into the air, I
gathered that he was finding some difficulty in
breathing.
</p>

<p>
"Sit on his head," hissed Tommy's voice.
"Take care he doesn't bite you.  He's as strong as
a horse."
</p>

<p>
I was attempting to carry out his instructions
when, with a mighty effort, our visitor jerked
himself clear enough to speak.
</p>

<p>
"All right, guv'nor," he gasped.  "I gives in."
</p>

<p>
He ceased to struggle, and, panting but triumphant,
we released our respective grips.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Mortimer arrived on the scene.
He looked down on us with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you seem to have got him all right," he
said.  "Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
Tommy mopped his forehead with the back of
his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's Sandow," he replied.  "Get up,
my friend, and let's have a squint at you."
</p>

<p>
The stranger rose rather stiffly into a sitting
posture.  "You've 'alf choked me, guv'nor," he
said reproachfully, putting his hand to his neck.
"You 'adn't no call to 'andle me like that."
</p>

<p>
We all three burst our laughing.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Tommy gravely.  "I was
under the impression that you were trying to kick
me in the stomach."
</p>

<p>
The stranger grinned, and somewhat painfully
clambered to his feet.
</p>

<p>
He was a massively built man of about forty,
swarthy and black-bearded, and clothed in the
conventional rags of a case-hardened tramp.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose we adjourn to the bungalow," I
suggested.  "I'm sure we all want a drink after
this little romp."
</p>

<p>
Tommy took the stranger's arm and tucked it
affectionately under his in that unbreakable clasp
invented by the Japanese.  Then dishevelled and
slightly out of breath, we retraced our steps to the
house.
</p>

<p>
"Where will Mr. Sandow sit?" I inquired, as
soon as we were all assembled in the front room.
</p>

<p>
"I would suggest somewhere not too near the
door," said Mortimer.  "I'm getting too old for
these sudden bursts of speed."
</p>

<p>
"This will do," said Tommy, pulling up a
rush-seated wooden chair with his foot.  "Take a pew,
my friend."
</p>

<p>
He dumped the stranger down into the seat, and
as he did so there came from the latter's pocket the
muffled but quite distinct chink of silver.
</p>

<p>
"There is music in the air," observed Mortimer
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"By gad," cried Tommy, "those must be our
spoons.  Trot 'em out, my son; the game's up,
you know."
</p>

<p>
Somewhat reluctantly, the stranger inserted his
hand into the gaping orifice which served him as a
pocket, and drew out a large number of spoons
wrapped up in a duster.  He laid them on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Tommy; "and now if we
may trouble you for the forks&mdash;ah, much obliged."
</p>

<p>
The forks followed, similarly protected, the
stranger all the time throwing little furtive glances
round the room, first at one of us and then at the
other.
</p>

<p>
While this interesting operation was in progress
I had been occupying myself mixing drinks.  I
offered one to Tommy, but he waved it aside.
</p>

<p>
"A guest," he said, "especially an uninvited
one, should always be served first."
</p>

<p>
I handed the tumbler to the stranger, who
accepted it with a grin and a nod.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Tommy, when we were all
three similarly equipped, "I think it would be
more friendly if we knew something about each
other."  He turned to the stranger.  "Wouldn't
you like to tell us your name, old sport?"
</p>

<p>
Our visitor looked at him cunningly.
</p>

<p>
"Me, guv'nor?" he said.  "I'm the Dock o'
Wellington."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" replied Tommy politely.  "I was sure
I'd seen your face somewhere.  If you won't think
me inquisitive, may I ask what brought you to the
island?"
</p>

<p>
The duke took a long drink.  Then he jerked his
thumb towards the steps.
</p>

<p>
"That there ruddy boat, guv'nor," he replied
casually.
</p>

<p>
"I said so," cried Mortimer.  "Now perhaps
you'll apologize, Tommy."
</p>

<p>
"What I want to know," I interrupted, "is why
you didn't clear out when you heard us on the
bank."
</p>

<p>
The duke eyed me contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"And 'ave you raisin' the 'ole bloomin' country
on me.  I don't think!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," broke in Mortimer; "his grace is a
sound tactician.  If he could have cut off with
the boat and left us here, he'd have been in
clover."
</p>

<p>
"As it is," I observed, "he's in the soup."
</p>

<p>
"Still, it wasn't much good your making for the
other side of the island," went on Mortimer,
addressing our guest.  "You couldn't get off that
way."
</p>

<p>
"Ho, couldn't I?" remarked the duke, with some
scorn.  "If I'd 'a' got to the bank fust you'd 'ave
know'd all about that.  It'd take six o' your sort
to ketch me in the water."
</p>

<p>
Tommy brought his hand down on the table
with a sudden bang that made us all jump.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove," he cried, "here's the very man we
want!  Listen here, Whiskers.  Suppose we find a
way of settling this little business without handing
you over to the police, eh?"
</p>

<p>
The duke blinked at him without any visible
sign of emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Wotjer gettin' at?" he inquired imperturbably.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the fact is," explained Tommy, "I've
got a little wager with the distinguished-looking
gentleman in the arm-chair.  I've bet him that I
could land the best swimmer in the world with a
salmon rod inside of half an hour."
</p>

<p>
"'Ave yer, guv'nor?" observed the duke.  "Then
ye can take it from me yer on a loser."
</p>

<p>
I gave a gentle laugh, which obviously nettled
Tommy.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you think you could get away?" he said.
</p>

<p>
The duke finished his whisky with some deliberation,
and set down the empty glass on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Think!" he repeated.  "I'm blinking well sure
as no blinking salmon rod would 'old me 'arf a
blinking minit."  ("Blinking" was not the precise
word that he used, but it will serve.)
</p>

<p>
Tommy turned to me with a grin.
</p>

<p>
"D'you feel like taking it on?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
I looked the duke over with a critical eye.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said; "I'll risk it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's put it to him," said Tommy.  "Look
here, my friend, if you're so cocksure I can't land
you, what d'you say to my having a shot at it?"
</p>

<p>
The duke glanced suspiciously round the circle.
</p>

<p>
"Wot do I get out of it?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You get out of going to quod," replied Tommy.
"Whatever happens, we'll land you on the bank
afterwards and let you clear off.  That's a bargain."
</p>

<p>
"And what's more," I put in, "I'll lay you a
pound to nothing that you don't break the line.
</p>

<p>
"Ye might make it a couple o' quid, guv'nor,"
observed his grace pathetically.  "It's worth that
to 'ave a damn great salmon 'ook shoved in yer."
</p>

<p>
There was a roar of laughter from all three
of us.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's a sportsman," I said, "whatever else
he is."  Then, turning to the duke, I explained
that the performance would not be of quite such a
realistic nature as he imagined.  "We'll lend you a
belt," I said, "and fasten the line to that.  Then
all you'll have to do will be to dive in and see if you
can get clear."
</p>

<p>
He rose with some alacrity.
</p>

<p>
"Ho, if that's all, I'm bloomin' well on!  It's a
walk over, guv'nor&mdash;that's wot it is, a ruddy walk
over."
</p>

<p>
"He can have my belt," said Tommy, unstrapping
the article in question and tossing it across.
"I'll go and get a salmon rod.  They're hanging up
in the passage."
</p>

<p>
He stepped through the archway, and took down
a rod from the row of pegs, carrying it out through
the side door into the garden, where we all three
joined him.
</p>

<p>
Both Mortimer and I felt hugely excited, but
neither the duke nor Tommy betrayed any special
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better take your Sunday suit off," said
the latter.  "It'll give you a better chance."
</p>

<p>
The duke shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'll just shift me boots," he announced.  "The
water won't 'urt these 'ere duds."
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary," said Mortimer unkindly,
"it ought to do 'em a bit of good.  But you'll
find it devilish wet walking afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"They'll dry quick enough," replied the duke,
"with this 'ere sun."
</p>

<p>
He sat down on the bank, and removed the
decayed shreds of leather that decorated his feet.
Then with some care he fastened Tommy's belt
round his waist.
</p>

<p>
"How are you going to fix the line?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"That's simple enough," said Tommy.  "There's
a ring at the back, you see.  I'll take off the hook
and fasten the gut to that."
</p>

<p>
He suited the action to the word, and in
about five minutes the operation was completed.
Tommy tested his handiwork with two or three
stiff jerks, which the duke resisted by sitting
peacefully on the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Can he have the benefit of the stream?" I
asked.  "If so, this side of the island is the best."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Tommy.  "I'll give you every
chance.  All I bargain is that Mortimer stands by
with a walking-stick.  If I get him close in enough
to be touched, I've won the bet."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," I agreed.  "That's fair."
</p>

<p>
The duke got up and inspected the stream.
</p>

<p>
"You can choose your own place," said Tommy.
"Only let's know when you're going to dive."
</p>

<p>
"Hold on," I said suddenly.  "I'd better bring
the boat round.  We don't want the chap to
drown, and if he gets loose in this stream, he'll
never fetch the island again."
</p>

<p>
I ran back to the steps, and getting into the
dinghy, tugged her round to where the others were
standing.  There I caught hold of a branch and
steadied myself against the bank.
</p>

<p>
"When you're ready," I called out.
</p>

<p>
With delightful coolness the duke sauntered to
the edge, where the river was deepest.
</p>

<p>
"All right, guv'nor?" he inquired, looking back
over his shoulder at Tommy.
</p>

<p>
The latter nodded, planting himself firmly on
the grass, with his legs well apart.
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, and then suddenly the
tattered figure on the bank shot outwards and
downwards, taking the water with a splash that
sent the spray flying in all directions.  Tommy
took a step forward, and the line went screaming
out like an angry wasp.
</p>

<p>
Tense with excitement, Mortimer and I stared
at the spot where the duke had disappeared.  He
came up some ten yards further on.  The line was
still fastened to his back, but without a moment's
hesitation he set off down stream, swimming with
a vigorous overhand stroke that carried him along
rapidly in the swift-running water.
</p>

<p>
He must have covered about twenty-five yards
before Tommy made his first attempt to check
him.  We saw the line tighten suddenly, and the
point of the rod bend double beneath the strain.
The effect on the duke was instantaneous.  Ceasing
to swim, he spun round in the water, and lay
on his back apparently as helpless as a floating log.
</p>

<p>
Very carefully Tommy began to wind him in.
Nearer and nearer he came, jerking along through
the broken water, and making no attempt to resist.
For a moment I thought it was all over, and then,
just as Mortimer was creeping down the bank with
the stick in his hand, there came another sharp
"whirr" from the reel, and away went the quarry
down the stream as vigorously as a freshrun
salmon.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" yelled Mortimer.  "He's making
for the rock!"
</p>

<p>
Away to the left a crest of grey stone reared itself
above swirling waters.  Towards this the duke was
swimming rapidly with the evident intention of
fouling the line.
</p>

<p>
Tommy saw the danger, and just at the right
moment put on the check.  The duke halted
abruptly, paused for a moment just where he was,
then suddenly rising high in the water, dived
beneath the surface like a dog-otter.  There was a
sharp snick, the rod jerked back with a swirl of
flying line, and Tommy sat down abruptly on the
bank.
</p>

<p>
With a shout of triumph I grabbed my oars,
and, shoving off the boat from the bank, sped
hastily to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
I was just in time.  Exhausted apparently by
his great effort, the duke was drifting feebly down
the current, devoting his remaining energies to
keeping his head above water.  I grabbed him by
the collar, and, with a mighty haul, succeeded in
lifting him up like some enervated porpoise over
the side of the dinghy.  With a grunt he collapsed
on the seat, and putting all my strength into it, I
tugged our craft back to the island.
</p>

<p>
Tommy, who is a sportsman to the backbone,
was standing on the bank with a stiff whisky-and-soda,
which he had secured from the bungalow.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are, Captain Webb," he said.  "Get
this down your neck, and you'll feel better."
</p>

<p>
The duke took the glass and shifted its contents
without a tremor.
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right, guv'nor," he said; "but you
nearly 'ad me."
</p>

<p>
Tommy laughed and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see where it broke," he said, turning his
late quarry round so as to examine the belt.  "By
Jove!  Just about the ring, and as clean as a
whistle!  Well, we'd better fix you up with a dry
shirt before you go.  I've got one I can spare you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye, guv'nor," said the duke.  "I could
do with a shirt."
</p>

<p>
Tommy disappeared into the house, returning a
moment later with the garment and a bottle of
whisky.
</p>

<p>
"Take this too," he said; "it'll keep the cold
out."
</p>

<p>
I groped in my pocket and produced a sovereign.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are," I added, handing it to our guest.
"I'll row you ashore."
</p>

<p>
We got back into the boat, the duke hugging his
whisky and his shirt; and steering a course a little
upstream, I pulled him over to the opposite bank.
Tommy and Mortimer stood on the island waving
us farewell.
</p>

<p>
When we reached our destination, I stood up
and offered him my hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, old friend," I said.  "Thank you
for winning my bet."
</p>

<p>
Very slowly he withdrew a hand from his pocket,
and with a sideways glance at the island opened it
so that I could see its contents.
</p>

<p>
"I'd never 'ave done it, guv'nor," he said
hoarsely, "if it 'adn't 'a' bin for these 'ere
wire-nippers."

<h3>
The Strange Adventure of Mr. Bates
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
Through the uncurtained window the yellow
light of the bar parlour streamed out into the
darkness of the November night.  Standing in the
road, his hand fingering the two odd coppers in his
trousers pocket, Mr. William Bates gazed irresolutely
at the inviting gleam.  He was weighing the
relative merits of a fire and a glass of beer at the
present moment against those of a crude but
satisfying breakfast of bread and cheese on the
following morning.  A clink of glasses, followed by a
sudden burst of laughter, seemed to decide the
matter, for, casting forethought aside, he advanced
up the cobbled pathway and pushed open the door
of the little country inn.
</p>

<p>
He found himself in a small, low-ceilinged room,
lit by a hanging lamp.  A wood fire was smouldering
away on the open hearth, and round its fragrant
glow two or three men were seated in various
attitudes of convivial comfort.  They all looked
up as he entered.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates, being an unobtrusive person by
nature, seated himself quietly on an oak settle
against the wall.  An enormously stout man, who
had discarded his coat and was smoking a
much-coloured churchwarden, rose slowly from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Even," he remarked in a genial rumble.
"Nasty night, ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates nodded and shivered.
</p>

<p>
"Come a bit closer to the fire, mate," went on
the landlord, for such was evidently the stout
gentleman's calling.  "You look fair perished."
</p>

<p>
Two of the men moved back their chairs, and
Mr. Bates, accepting the invitation, shifted into a
vacant seat at the corner of the hearth.
</p>

<p>
"Glass of beer, please," he said, as the landlord,
with an interrogative glance, threw up a small
wooden partition that communicated with the bar.
</p>

<p>
The refreshment having arrived, and Mr. Bates
having parted with three of his four last
half-pennies, the general conversation interrupted by
his entrance was resumed.
</p>

<p>
"Seems to be something funny about it," observed
the landlord, looking across at the thin
man with gaiters who was sitting on the edge of
the table.
</p>

<p>
"Blooming funny!" emphasized the local postman.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that were his message, any'ow.  'E says:
'Tell 'Orniman that I'll be along with my box by
'alf-past nine, and that I'll be wanting to sleep the
night,'  'E's 'ad a proper row with the old man
and chucked 'is job&mdash;that's what 'e's done."
</p>

<p>
"Got the sack, more like," observed the
postman, spitting ironically into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"That's as it may be; anyway, I've gived the
message."
</p>

<p>
"What's the Professor going to do?" inquired
the landlord.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said the man with gaiters.  "Advertise
for summon else, I suppose.  'E won't 'ave no
women about the place, that's certain."
</p>

<p>
"Job worth 'aving," put in a red-whiskered man
who had not previously spoken&mdash;"at least, judgin'
by the amount o' drink Andrew got through."
</p>

<p>
"No one can say as Andrew weren't free with 'is
money," observed the gaitered man.
</p>

<p>
"If it <i>were</i> 'is money," put in the postman
unkindly.
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of steps outside, and the
sudden thud of a heavy weight on the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Here 'i is," said the landlord.
</p>

<p>
The door swung open, and Mr. Bates, looking
up, saw a man enter.  He was a pale-faced, sandy-haired
individual, with a sharp nose, watery eyes,
and a general air of somewhat dissipated insolence.
</p>

<p>
"Good 'evenin', gentlemen all," he remarked.
"Hallo, Potter!  Give me message to Horniman?"
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, Mr. Andrew," answered the
landlord.  "There's a room upstairs if you want
one.  I'll send George along to get your box in."
</p>

<p>
"Wot's the meanin' of all this 'ere bust up?"
inquired the red-whiskered man, as the new-comer
settled himself down with a large glass of Hollands
in front of him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Andrew laughed with a fine assumption of
independence.  "Jest got sick of the old swine,
and told 'im so," he replied.  "Nearly 'ad a fit
when I gave 'im notice."
</p>

<p>
"Must 'a' bin a blow to 'im," said the postman.
"Did you get your last week's wages?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Andrew looked across coldly.  "He offered
me a cheque," he said, "but I told 'im to keep it
and get 'is 'air cut."
</p>

<p>
"And then you woke up, I s'pose," added the
postman.
</p>

<p>
"What'll the Professor do without you, Mr. Andrew?"
inquired the landlord, anxious to relieve
the somewhat strained situation.
</p>

<p>
"Have to look after 'imself for a day or two, I
'ope, and I've left some work for 'im, I'll warrant
you.  There's all yesterday's things unwashed, 'is
rotten old boots dirty, the stores mixed up, and
every window and door in the place unfastened.  I
only 'ope," he added viciously, "as some tramp'll
come along and clean out the whole place before 'e
finds out!  I'd 'alf a mind to chalk up a notice on
the gate opposite, sayin' that the kitchen windows
at The Firs was unlatched, and that there was
plenty of grub and drink for any one who chose to
walk in and 'elp themselves."
</p>

<p>
In the laughter that followed this spirited
harangue, Mr. Bates turned to his next-door
neighbour, a quiet man who had not spoken yet,
and inquired in a subdued voice:
</p>

<p>
"The Firs?  Ain't that the house I passed
coming along&mdash;a little white place standing back
on the left?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it, mate," answered the other.  "Professor
Stenson's.  Andrew 'ere was 'is servant."
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me," observed the gentleman with
gaiters, addressing the hero of the evening, "as
you've got your own back out of him."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Andrew grinned complacently.  "I don't
believe in bein' put on," he admitted.  "One
man's as good as another, I say, and I like to be
treated with proper respect."
</p>

<p>
"And not kicked out of the 'ouse, like a thief, at
a minute's notice," added the postman.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of unpleasant silence.
</p>

<p>
"If you're trying to insinooate&mdash;" began
Mr. Andrew hotly.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't trying to insinooate nothing," said the
postman.  "It's my opinion as the Professor's a
gentleman&mdash;a proper gentleman 'e is, and 'e always
treated you a sight too well.  If I'd been in 's shoes,
you'd 'ave been out of it long ago.  That's my opinion,
Mister Andrew, and if you don't like it, you can
shove it in your pipe and dam well smoke it."
</p>

<p>
So saying, the postman emptied his pot of beer,
and, buttoning his uniform, rose defiantly to his
feet.  Before the heated atmosphere had a chance
to burst, however, the landlord again intervened,
this time with the full majesty of law behind him.
</p>

<p>
"One minute past ten!" he cried, snapping a
huge watch which he had extracted from the
depths of his waistcoat.  "I'll be losin' my licence,
standin' 'ere listenin' to your jokin'.  Come
along, George&mdash;get up the shutters."
</p>

<p>
George, an aged, lop-sided gentleman, shuffled
out from the bar, and the whole company, with the
exception of the indignant and heavily breathing
Mr. Andrew, rose reluctantly to their feet.  There
was a general feeling of disappointment that such a
promising situation should have come to so tame a
conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates passed through the door with the rest
into the darkness outside.
</p>

<p>
Though it was not actually raining, only a
shameless optimist could have described it as a fine
night.  A raw November mist brooded unpleasantly
over everything, offering a dismal contrast
to the warmth and brightness of the little
bar-parlour.  Under the circumstances, nobody stayed
to gossip on the doorstep, even the thrilling topic
of Mr. Andrew's resignation being mutually
abandoned.  There was a general turning up of
coat-collars, the flare of a match, a "Good-night,
Tom!"&mdash;"Comin' my way, Potter?" and all the
late revellers clumped away to their respective
homes&mdash;all of them, that is to say, except
Mr. Bates.  He, unfortunately, had no home to go to.
</p>

<p>
He stood still, listening to the retreating footsteps.
Then, with a faint sigh, he thrust his hands
into his pockets and began to walk slowly back
along the road in the direction from which he had
arrived at the inn.
</p>

<p>
He had covered nearly a quarter of a mile in this
fashion when a few yards ahead the dull yellow
blue of an oil lamp suddenly appeared through the
mist.  Mr. Bates stopped and began to peer
anxiously through the gloom on his left.
</p>

<p>
"Ought to be jest about here," he muttered, "if
I ain't made a mistake."  The shadowy outline of
a white gate rewarded his efforts.  He climbed
carefully over it, and feeling his way by means of a
wall that ran at right angles to the road, arrived at
a low stone building, which, as far as could be seen
in the darkness, bore the appearance of a discarded
cowshed.
</p>

<p>
Through an aperture that in more spacious days
had probably been the site of a doorway, Mr. Bates
passed in to his hotel.  It was black inside, with
that peculiar quality of blackness which seems to
affect the breathing power, and there was a faint
odour of immemorial cows.  Mr. Bates struck a
match, and by its spluttering light glanced
nervously about him.  Against the opposite wall he
detected a rough manger, which seemed to be free
of some of the less pleasing features of the floor.
A year ago Mr. Bates might have sniffed at its
possibilities as a bedstead, but recent experience
had rendered him less critical.  Igniting a second
match, he made a further inspection, which
resulted in the discovery of a couple of indescribably
filthy sacks.  One of these he rolled up into a
pillow and placed in the manger, and then, scrambling
in himself and lying down, he drew the other
luxuriously over his tired limbs.  Some twenty
minutes later the sound of deep, steady breathing
showed that he was temporarily oblivious of the
discomforts of the ill-arranged planet.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five.
</p>

<p>
The last stroke of the village church clock died
slowly away, and only the dreary, persistent patter
of the rain upon the dead leaves disturbed the
uncanny stillness of a sleeping world.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates stood irresolutely in the wet darkness,
his hand upon the gate which led into the domains
of Professor Stenson.  At last, very cautiously, he
pushed it open and stepped inside.
</p>

<p>
Before him lay the drive, lined by laurels and
overhung by several gaunt, leafless elms.  It was
even blacker than the roadway.  Step by step he
felt his way along, till all of a sudden the shrubbery
came to an end, and he found himself at the edge
of a small gravelled space facing the front door.
</p>

<p>
At the side of the house he could just discern a
path, which appeared to run round to the back.
Crouching down and moving his feet as noiselessly
as possible, he advanced along it, keeping
one hand against the ivy-clad wall to guide his
steps.
</p>

<p>
After about twelve yards of this uncomfortable
progress, he came round the corner into a small
square yard.  There was a back door with two
windows on either side of it, while above these
again were, apparently three rooms.  All were in
complete darkness.
</p>

<p>
With his heart in his mouth, Mr. Bates crept up
to the first window and peered through.  He could
see nothing.  It was like staring into a sheet of
black paper.  For a second he hesitated, and then,
placing his hand against the sash of the bottom
pane, gave it a gentle tentative push.  It yielded
instantly to his pressure, sliding up a matter of two
or three inches with a wheezy rattle that made him
start back in a fresh access of alarm.  Surely
someone must have heard it!  He half turned to
run, and then paused irresolutely, his ears strained
for the first sound of any movement within the
house.
</p>

<p>
Nothing happened, however, and, after waiting
several minutes, Mr. Bates regained his courage.
Very gingerly he again raised the sash, and with
extreme caution inserted his head through the
empty window-frame.  It was the kitchen; of that
there could be no doubt, an unpleasing odour of
boiled cabbage and damp clothes and dirty plates
attesting to the professional deficiencies of the
owner's late servant.
</p>

<p>
Raising himself upon his hands, Mr. Bates lifted
his leg and scrambled in noiselessly over the sill.
Then he felt in his pocket for a match.  By the aid
of a dry portion of his trousers he struck it without
any superfluous noise, and, shading it with his
hand, gazed nervously about him.
</p>

<p>
It was evident that Mr. Andrew's vaunt had not
been an entirely idle one.  The room was in a state
of shocking disorder.  Heaped up anyhow on the
table were the dirty appliances of at least three
meals.  A mountainous pile of ashes beneath the
grate bore eloquent testimony to daily tasks
neglected, and at least three pairs of uncleaned
boots scattered about the floor did nothing to
remove the impression.  Mr. Bates looked round
with a disapproving and disgusted eye.  A tidy
man by nature and training, his fingers itched to
set about this confusion.
</p>

<p>
The flame of the match reaching his thumb,
however, reminded him sharply that he was there
upon other and more pressing business.  Dropping
the charred stump with a mild and whispered oath,
he ignited a second, and by its light perceived, on
the further side of the apartment, an open door
leading into a larder.  On a shelf against the wall
he could just detect the outline of a cold chicken,
apparently still intact.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates did not wait for an invitation.  In a
moment he had crossed the floor and entered this
attractive storehouse.  Seizing the chicken, he
held up the match and gazed round for further
contributions.  Half a loaf of bread was the first
object to meet his eye, and this, together with a
small piece of German sausage, which he found
on a plate behind it, satisfied his requirements.
Thrusting his booty under his arm, and throwing
down his second match, which by this time had
burnt itself away, he stepped out into the darkness
of the kitchen.  As he did so, a slight sound made
him pause.  An instant later there was a sharp
click, and then a blinding flare of electric light
suddenly flooded the room.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates staggered back against the wall, his
plunder and his jaw dropping at the same moment.
An elderly gentleman in a Jaeger dressing-gown
with a revolver in his hand, was leaning comfortably
against the kitchen door.  He was clean-shaven,
with longish white hair.  A pleasant, if
somewhat ironical, smile lurked about his face.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Flagrante delicto</i>, Mr. Burglar," he remarked,
"or, to use a language with which you are possibly
better acquainted, caught in the act, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates licked his lips, which felt very dry.
"Yes, sir," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"You will oblige me by keeping your hands
above your head.  Thank you.  Now permit me
to introduce myself.  My name is Professor
Stenson."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," repeated Mr. Bates hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"And yours, my friend?"
</p>

<p>
"William Bates, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And if you won't think me inquisitive, Mr. Bates,
may I ask what you are doing in my house
at this time in the morning?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates wriggled, his eyes glued on the muzzle
of the revolver.
</p>

<p>
"The fact is, sir," he jerked out, "I was hungry, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said the Professor, "and I suppose you
mistook The Firs for an hotel.  That is the worst of
modern architecture&mdash;it has no distinctive note."
</p>

<p>
With this statement Mr. Bates apparently
agreed.  At all events, he offered no comment on
it.  When he spoke again, which he did after a
brief pause, his topic was of an altogether different
nature.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, sir," he stammered nervously,
"would you mind not pointing that thing at me,
sir?  It might go off."
</p>

<p>
"I have no particular wish to point it at you,"
replied the Professor.  "The posture is both
fatiguing and ridiculous.  If you will take your
coat off and place it on the floor, so that I can see
that you are not armed, I shall be delighted to
assume a less martial attitude.  Be good enough
to keep your hands from your pockets while you
are doing it, or I shall shoot you without
hesitation."
</p>

<p>
With shaking fingers Mr. Bates proceeded to
disrobe, being very careful to hold his tattered
garment by the extreme edge.  Having shed it, he
stood in his shirt-sleeves, looking about as
dishevelled and miserable a housebreaker as ever
cracked a crib.
</p>

<p>
His captor gazed at him thoughtfully for a
moment, and then lowered his weapon.  Mr. Bates
breathed an audible sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"And now we are at our ease," said the Professor,
"I should be interested to hear a little more about
you.  If you won't think me insulting, your
methods, from the technical point of view, appear
to be deplorably amateurish.  Why didn't you
lock the kitchen door?"
</p>

<p>
There was something in the Professor's tone
which made Mr. Bates feel a shade less like a
trapped rat.  He even drew himself up with a
pathetic effort at courage.
</p>

<p>
"I assure you, sir," he said earnestly, "I am no
burglar."
</p>

<p>
The Professor looked at him quizzically.
</p>

<p>
"I am inclined to agree with you, Mr. Bates,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"It was very wrong of me to come in here, sir, I
admit, but I was hungry, sir&mdash;desperately hungry&mdash;and
I knew I should find some food inside.  I
assure you, sir, I had no intention of taking away
anything else."
</p>

<p>
"And may I inquire why you were so certain
about the contents of my kitchen?  Indeed, how
did you even know it was the kitchen?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please, sir, it was hearing what
Mr. Andrew said at the inn last night."
</p>

<p>
A sudden look of illumination flashed across the
Professor's face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said, "so that is how the land lies, is it?
I am indebted to the gentle Andrew for the pleasure
of your acquaintance, eh?  Well, come, come, don't
be reticent, my friend; let us have the whole story."
</p>

<p>
Bit by bit, with his eye still on the revolver,
Mr. Bates proceeded to relate the incidents of the
previous night, from the time of his entry into the
inn.  The Professor listened to him without
interrupting, the same curious, half-ironical,
half-good-natured smile playing all the time about his
mouth.  Once, when he heard of the postman's
final remark, he laughed out loud.
</p>

<p>
"So Mercury is evidently a gentleman of
penetration," he observed.  "What did you think of
Andrew yourself, Mr. Bates?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't like him at all, sir.  He seemed to me a
shifty, incompetent fellow, and insolent, sir&mdash;very
insolent."
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you are right," said the Professor.
"He was only insolent to me once, but that may
have been for lack of a second opportunity.
Shifty he certainly was, and as for incompetence&mdash;well,
look at the state of this kitchen, Mr. Bates."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates looked.  "Yes, sir," he said warmly,
"it's disgraceful.  It was the first thing I noticed
as I came in.  When I was&mdash;"  He stopped
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, well, when you were what?  Let us
have it, my friend."
</p>

<p>
"I was going to say, sir, that, when I was in
service, I should have died of shame if any one
had seen my kitchen in such a state."
</p>

<p>
The Professor raised his eyebrows.  "When
you were in service, eh?  So you have risen in the
world, Mr. Bates!  And how long is it since you
have exchanged the livery for the crape and jack-boots?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"When was your last professional engagement?"
</p>

<p>
"I have been out of a place, sir, since I left
Mr. Houghton, eighteen months ago."
</p>

<p>
"And what were you doing for Mr. Houghton?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything, sir.  He was a bachelor gentleman,
and didn't care to have women servants
about the house, so I looked after him entirely."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!  How extremely fortunate!"
exclaimed the Professor.  "Your visit is what the
vicar would call almost providential, Mr. Bates.
Before I discharge my duty as a citizen, by
handing you over to the local policeman, you will be
able to straighten out all this distressing confusion
for me.  If you do it efficiently, it will doubtless be
taken into consideration by the magistrate."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," murmured Mr. Bates dejectedly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, suppose we start upon the boots, then.
It will be pleasant to have a pair of boots properly
cleaned again.  You will find the brushes and some
blacking in that cupboard."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates opened the door and took out the articles
in question.  He then collected the three pairs
of boots which were scattered about the floor, and
silently set to work.  The Professor, sitting on a
corner of the kitchen table, with the revolver dangling
in his hand, watched him with amused interest.
</p>

<p>
When the last boot was finished and laid aside,
he got up.
</p>

<p>
"Your work reflects great credit on you,
Mr. Bates," he remarked approvingly.  "I shall be
proud to wear them.  Do you think you are
equally skilful at washing up plates and dishes?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so, sir," said Mr. Bates meekly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we may as well make certain, eh?  Suppose
you collect some of these and bring them into
the scullery."
</p>

<p>
He pushed open a third door, and turned on a
switch.
</p>

<p>
"There is a gas-stove in here, so we can have
plenty of hot water in a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
Scraping the various remnants from the plates
and dishes, Mr. Bates heaped the latter up into
two piles and carried them into the scullery.  The
Professor meanwhile had filled a large washing-up
pan with water and placed it on the stove.
</p>

<p>
"While we are waiting for it to boil," he said,
"you might tell me a little more about your past
history.  In view of your accomplishments, how
did Mr. Houghton ever bring himself to part with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Please, sir, he died."
</p>

<p>
"A pity," said the Professor.  "But surely you
should have found little difficulty in obtaining
another place?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates hung his head.
</p>

<p>
The Professor looked at him.  "Ah," he said,
after a short pause.  "I thought there must be
some reason.  Come, Mr. Bates, what's the
trouble?  Never be afraid to speak the truth."
</p>

<p>
"I was out of a place for about three months, sir,
and&mdash;and my wife got very ill, sir, and I had spent
all my savings.  The doctor said that the only
chance of saving her was to send her out of London.
I went to call on a gentleman about a place, and
while I was waiting, sir, I&mdash;I&mdash;I saw a couple of
sovereigns on the mantelpiece, and I took them, sir."
</p>

<p>
"That was very wrong of you, Mr. Bates," said
the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What happened?"
</p>

<p>
"The money was missed, and I was arrested, sir.
The magistrate was very good to me.  He might
have sent me to prison, but he only bound me over.
I am very grateful to him, sir.  Still, that finished
me as far as work was concerned, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And your wife?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates suddenly began to cry.  "My wife is
dead, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," said the Professor, turning his head
away, "dear me!"
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, during which
Mr. Bates began mechanically to wash up.  The
Professor sat in silence while plate after plate was
cleaned and put aside.  When both piles were
finished, he looked up at the small clock which was
ticking away on the mantelpiece.  The time was
about five-and-twenty minutes to seven.
</p>

<p>
"It is a little early for breakfast," he remarked,
"but I think that, as you are here, Mr. Bates, I
will take advantage of the fact by getting you to
cook me some eggs and bacon.  There ought to be
plenty, unless Andrew has excelled himself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Mr. Bates.
</p>

<p>
The Professor went out into the larder, returning
almost immediately with the required provisions.
</p>

<p>
"If you will cook these," he said, "I will go on
with laying the table."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't you trouble, sir&mdash;I can do it, sir,"
protested Mr. Bates.
</p>

<p>
"Please do what you are asked, Mr. Bates.
And you might make some tea at the same time;
the canister is on the shelf above you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And bring it all into the kitchen as soon as it is
ready."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
The fragrant smell of the hissing eggs and bacon
was the most exquisite torture to Mr. Bates.  An
agonised longing to seize some of the food and stuff
it into his mouth almost dazed him with its
intensity.  Nevertheless, he firmly proceeded with his
task, turning out a succulent steaming dish, just
cooked to precisely the right point.  Then he
made the tea, and taking down a plate which he
had put to warm, placed the whole lot upon a tray,
and carried it into the kitchen.  The Professor was
sitting at the table, which was laid for two.
</p>

<p>
"Excellent," he said, taking off the cover and
looking at the contents.  "But how is this&mdash;you
have only brought one hot plate?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought that was all you would require, sir."
</p>

<p>
"But there is yourself, Mr. Bates.  I laid a place
for you under the impression that you were
hungry."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir," said Mr. Bates, with a little gasp, "if
I may have something outside, sir!  I&mdash;I should
hardly like to sit down with you, sir."
</p>

<p>
The Professor raised his eyebrows again.
"Really, Mr. Bates, a little more self-respect, if
you please.  You must remember that you are a
burglar now, not a valet."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates seated himself in the second chair,
and the Professor, whose appetite seemed suddenly
to have vanished, helped him to about seven-eighths
of the eggs and bacon.  Mr. Bates fell
upon them with as much ferocity as his
professional refinement would permit.
</p>

<p>
The Professor handed him a cup of tea, and after
watching him for a minute, got up and walked to
where a telephone was fastened to the wall.  He
took off the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Are you there?" he said.  "Please put me on
to the London Exchange.  Yes, thank you.
Don't you bother, Mr. Bates, go on with your
breakfast.  Is that the Exchange?  I want 400
City.  Yes.  Help yourself to some more tea when
you want it, Mr. Bates.  Are you there?  Is that
Scotland Yard?  Professor Stenson.  Would you
ask Inspector Green to come to the telephone?
All right.  You will find some marmalade in the
white pot, Mr. Bates.  Is that you, Green?  Yes.
I want you to do something for me.  It's just to
look up the record of a man named William Bates,
who was bound over at&mdash;where was it,
Mr. Bates?&mdash;ah&mdash;Marylebone, on&mdash;what date?&mdash;May 7th.
I should like to have any information you possess."
</p>

<p>
He turned and contemplated Mr. Bates, who
was staring at him with his mouth open.
</p>

<p>
"Wonderful invention, the telephone, isn't it,
Mr. Bates?" he remarked.  "It keeps us so in
touch with the actual facts of existence.  But
don't let my private business interfere with your
breakfast.  You must be hungry after your
somewhat uncomfortable night."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates said nothing.  He seemed content to
stare and eat.
</p>

<p>
Another minute or two elapsed.  "Yes, I'm
here," said the Professor suddenly, turning again
to the instrument.  "Thanks."  A pause.
"What&mdash;what's that?"  Another and longer pause.
"Oh, thanks very much.  Yes, that's all.  I shall
probably see you Wednesday.  I hope to look in
about that Stevenson case.  Yes.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
He hung up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Bates," said he, approaching the table,
"it appears that you have spoken the truth."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bates gulped down his last mouthful.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," he said.
</p>

<p>
The Professor eyed him for a moment severely.
</p>

<p>
"It is, of course, my duty," he said, "to hand
you over to the law."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"But, being opposed to carrying duty to too
logical an extreme, I am prepared to make you an
alternative offer.  If you would care to take the
place of the professionally defunct Mr. Andrew, I
am willing to give you a trial.  Your work would
be to devote the same care and skill to my comfort
that you doubtless bestowed upon the late
Mr. Houghton.  Your wages will be fifty pounds a
year, and I shall give you a fortnight's holiday."
</p>

<p>
For a naturally reserved and properly trained
servant, Mr. Bates's response was unpardonable.
Rising to his feet, he staggered round the table,
and falling on his knees in front of the Professor,
began feebly groping for the latter's hand.  He
was sobbing so loudly that it was difficult to hear
what he said.  It sounded like:
</p>

<p>
"Thank you&mdash;oh, thank you, sir!  God bless
you, sir!"
</p>

<p>
For the third time the Professor raised his
eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Bates," he said, "a little more self-control,
if you please.  You must remember that
you are a valet now, not a burglar."

<h3>
A Bit of Old Chelsea
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We were strolling through the restful streets of
Chelsea when we came suddenly upon a picturesque
little tavern close to the Thames.  It was half
covered with ivy, and from the wooden balcony
above, long trailing geraniums hung down and
mingled with the dark green leaves.  There was a
weather-beaten signboard with a picture of a
cunning-looking man in a cocked hat.  It was
called the "Lord Nelson."
</p>

<p>
"That's a quaint old place," said George carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Very," I replied; "so picturesque."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what it's like inside.  Shall we have
a look?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I said.
</p>

<p>
I always try to fall in with my friend's wishes,
even when I don't approve of them.  I may be
wrong, but that is my idea of friendship.
</p>

<p>
George is a journalist with a strange craving for
the interiors of taverns.  He says they are such
excellent places in which to study character.
From the outsider's point of view studying character
seems to be the chief part of journalism, and
I should think few men worked harder at it than
George does.
</p>

<p>
We pushed open a door marked "Saloon," and
found ourselves in a narrow compartment just
large enough to contain four people without
inconvenience.  One of the seats was already
occupied by an amiable-looking wreck, who was
fast asleep with his head on the counter.  The
public bar exactly opposite contained five or six
navvies in various stages of intoxication, and the
barman, a smart-looking man of about thirty-five,
was attending to their wants.
</p>

<p>
"Seems a bit tired," remarked George, looking
critically at our companion.
</p>

<p>
"Been studying too much character," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
George was just beginning a sarcastic reply
when the barman came across to take our orders.
We decided on two glasses of what I once heard a
temperance lecturer describe as "hell-filling
alcohol," and while the barman was getting them
ready George entered into conversation with him.
</p>

<p>
"Who's our friend?" he inquired, indicating the
recumbent reveller in the corner.
</p>

<p>
"Dunno 'is name," said the barman, snipping
the wire off the Perrier.  "Calls 'im Billy
Borndrunk round 'ere, and 'e seems satisfied."
</p>

<p>
"Got a pretty tough lot opposite, haven't you?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
The barman's face assumed an expression of
intense disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Trash," he remarked.  "They're mendin' the
Embankment, and come along 'ere after work.
They fair mop it, I can tell yer, and then they gits
narsty.  I'll 'ave to learn 'em something afore I'm
done with 'em."
</p>

<p>
He was only five-foot-six, but he spoke with
confidence, and I felt that it was no vain boasting.
</p>

<p>
"You know something about it, eh?"
</p>

<p>
He closed an eye and smiled scornfully.  "Quite
enough for any o' them to go on with."
</p>

<p>
Then he left us, for the gentlemen opposite were
becoming clamorous for more liquor.
</p>

<p>
During the next few minutes we sat there in
silence.  George was evidently making a mental
sketch of Billy Borndrunk, and with the sympathy
of the true artist I refrained from interrupting
him.  I amused myself by idly scanning the various
bottles which were piled up on shelves at the
bade, together with a few packets of cheap
cigarettes and some weary-looking ferns.  This is a
favourite pastime of mine when George insists on
taking me into taverns.  I like to speculate dreamily
upon the various flavours.  If one is not really fond
of drink one can do this without feeling ashamed.
It becomes a purely intellectual pursuit.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I was aware of a disturbance in the
opposite bar.  A dialogue was in progress between
my friend the barman and a gigantic navvy,
proportionately inebriated.
</p>

<p>
"Pot o' 'arf-an'-'arf, an' not ser much jaw,"
demanded the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Yer won't get no more 'ere," replied the barman
coldly.  "Yer drunk as it is.  Go 'ome to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Oo-oose drunk?" inquired the navvy indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"You are," said the barman, "beastly."
</p>

<p>
Then civilization slipped off the navvy like a
discarded cloak.
</p>

<p>
"I'm drunk, am I!" he roared.  "Tike that!"  His
fist shot out, and, landing somewhere in the
neighbourhood of the barman's right eye, drove
that gentleman across the bar with such velocity
that he struck the counter close to us with
considerable force.
</p>

<p>
"That's for yer cheek," observed the navvy
in the voice of one whose honour has been satisfied.
</p>

<p>
The remaining customers, with the honourable
exception of Billy Borndrunk, rose hastily to their
feet, and a chorus of criticism filled the tavern.
"Serve 'im right!" "Shut yer 'ead!" "Don't
be a fool, Bill!" "Hit him back!"  This last from
George.
</p>

<p>
I remembered the barman's boast, and was
silent in pleasant expectation.
</p>

<p>
To my intense disappointment, however, the
blow seemed to have cowed him.  He pulled himself
together and slowly retraced his steps, holding
his hand up to his face.
</p>

<p>
"You 'adn't no call to 'it me like that," he
began reproachfully.  "What's your order?"
</p>

<p>
"Pot o' 'arf-an'-'arf; and when I comes in 'ere
again, per'aps ye'll be a bit more perlite&mdash;see?"
</p>

<p>
The navvy leaned across the counter and
grinned derisively.
</p>

<p>
He never grinned again&mdash;at least, not under
similar circumstances.  With amazing swiftness
the barman whipped out a large pewter pot from
under the counter and struck him a swinging blow
across the face, sending him to the floor with a thud
that shook the building.
</p>

<p>
"That's for <i>your</i> cheek," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
Then he coolly picked up the cloth and began to
polish the tankard.  "That's the worst o' them
dirty faces," he observed.  "Spoils the silver."
</p>

<p>
An awe-struck silence fell upon us all, while the
navvy rose up slowly with the brand of can upon
his cheek.  I do not know how to spell the words,
or I would tell you what he said.  When he had
done the barman eyed him critically.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't got much time to spare for pleasure,"
he replied, "but if yer likes to step round to the
yard be'ind, we'll give that there mark a bit o'
company."
</p>

<p>
The navvy's eyes glistened, and the whole
tavern, with the exception of Billy Borndrunk,
rose joyously to the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
The barman walked to the side door and called
his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Annie," he said, "just look after the bar while
I show these gen'lemen our backyard."
</p>

<p>
We all trooped out, leaving Billy Borndrunk in
sole possession.  It seemed a shame that he should
miss the fight, but it would have taken some hours
to wake him up, and by that time everything
would have been over.
</p>

<p>
Outside we were joined by two or three stray
inhabitants of Chelsea, who had been busily
engaged in their usual strenuous work of leaning
over the railings and spitting in the Thames.
Scenting a welcome diversion, they lounged up
and listened with philosophic calm to the navvy's
lurid descriptions of how he was about to operate
upon his opponent.
</p>

<p>
Then there was a sound of bolts being withdrawn,
and the barman opened the gate that led
into the yard.  It was quite small, paved with
cobbles, and surrounded by high brick walls:
scarcely the place that I should have selected for
a fight unless I felt very certain that I was going
to win.  The barman closed the gate, and we all
ranged ourselves round the walls, while he and the
navvy removed their superfluous clothing and took
up their positions in opposite corners.  George,
who is a bit of a sportsman, volunteered to act as
timekeeper.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of almost breathless silence
and then he gave the word:
</p>

<p>
"Time!"
</p>

<p>
The barman took three quick steps forward,
and planted himself firmly in the centre of the ring.
In another second the navvy was upon him&mdash;head
down and hitting like a flail.  There was a
gorgeous whirl of arms, a couple of sharp smacking
blows, and the navvy suddenly sat down with his
hand to his eye, while the little man danced away
apparently uninjured.
</p>

<p>
Two or three of the fallen warrior's companions
advanced and set him upon his feet.  "Go fur 'is
wind, Bill," suggested one.  "Stand orf an' fight
'im clever," added another.  "Close wiv 'im," said
a third.
</p>

<p>
The navvy drew the back of his hand across his
face and shoved them roughly aside.  "I'll kill 'im
afore I done with 'im," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
His friends retreated to the wall, and the two
men faced each other again.  This time it was the
barman's turn to attack.  Without a moment's
hesitation he waltzed in, and, ducking a terrific
swing, landed a straight left on his opponent's nose
that brought a roar of mingled anguish and fury
from its owner's lips.  Whether it was the pain,
or whether the blood of some forgotten French
ancestor was stirring in his veins, I cannot say,
but the navvy now threw aside all pretensions to
following the rules of the ring, and, rushing forward
kicked at his enemy with all the force of which he
was capable.  My heart seemed to jump into my
mouth for I felt certain that the barman's hour
had come.  The navvy's boot looked as if it were
capable of opening the door for any soul in England.
</p>

<p>
With a brilliant effort, however, the barman
leaped on one side, and, using his right hand for
the first time in the fight, smote the navvy a
deadly blow across his disfigured countenance
that stretched him upon the yard and abruptly
terminated the struggle.
</p>

<p>
George counted him out with all the dignity of
a professional timekeeper, but he made no effort
to rise, for the barman stood over him, waiting to
rebuke him for his attempted treachery.  Then he
began to roll about as though in great pain.
</p>

<p>
"Brandy!" he moaned feebly.  "Gimme some
brandy!"
</p>

<p>
The barman walked across the yard and picked
up a huge bucket of clean water.  He had evidently
guessed the navvy's weak point, for the
latter rose quickly, if somewhat unsteadily, to his
feet, with the expression of a man who has
narrowly escaped some strange and horrible danger.
He staggered slowly to the gate, and then, turning
round, addressed his late opponent in a voice of
dignified rebuke.
</p>

<p>
"Thash 'ow you lose cushtom.  I shan't come
'ere no more."
</p>

<h3>
The Microbe
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Wot's a microbe, Sam?" inquired Bill Gerridge,
putting down his pipe, and looking up from
the paper which he had been laboriously reading
for the last quarter of an hour.
</p>

<p>
"A microbe!" repeated Sam doubtfully.  "Why
a sort o' hinsect&mdash;ain't it, Mr. Parbury?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it ain't exactly a insect," answered
Mr. Parbury with some deliberation.  "More like a
reptile, as yer might say.  Somethin' arter the
nature of a rat with wings."
</p>

<p>
"Kind o' bat?" put in Bill.
</p>

<p>
"You've got it," agreed Mr. Parbury.  "Any'ow,
they're dangerous beasts."
</p>

<p>
"'Ow's that?" asked Sam.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parbury took a long pull at his pewter
tankard, and then replaced it on the table.  "Yer
know wot a mad dog's like, don't yer?" he said
impressively.  "Well, yer can take it from me that
a mad dog ain't in it with a microbe.  Once a
microbe gets a fair 'old on yer, ye're a goner an' no
error."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" demanded Bill sceptically.  "Wot do
they do to yer?"
</p>

<p>
"Do to yer?" echoed Mr. Parbury.  "Poisons
yer!  That's wot they do to yer.  Each microbe's
got some special disease of 'is own like, and 'e only
'as to get in one nip an' 'e can pass it on&mdash;see?"
</p>

<p>
"Why don't they muzzle 'em or stamp 'em out?"
suggested Sam, who had a practical mind.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parbury laughed scornfully.  "Ah!" he
said, "that would take a bit o' doin', that would.
The only chaps wot understands the way to deal
with microbes is doctors.  They get so used to 'em
they can 'andle 'em like terriers.  Didn't I never
tell yer that yarn o' Spikey Joe's, 'bout the doctor
wot were in the Scrubs same time as 'e were?"
</p>

<p>
Sam shook his head, while Bill's naturally
expressionless face betrayed no sign of recognition.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy my not 'avin' told yer that," said
Mr. Parbury musingly.  "Wonnerful interestin' story
too.  If I weren't so uncommon dry, I'd tell it yer
now."
</p>

<p>
Sam waited a moment or two to see if Bill were
going to speak, and then remarked with a faint
touch of resentment in his voice:
</p>

<p>
"Give it a name, Mr. Parbury."
</p>

<p>
Comfortably installed, with a fresh "bitter and
Burton" at his elbow, Mr. Parbury repeated,
nodding his head and smiling gently to himself,
"It's a wonnerful interestin' story, that is.  Spikey
Joe told it to me 'isself one night at the Star and
Anchor.  Ye mind 'ow 'e got into trouble 'bout
four years back, on account o' knockin' a copper
over the 'ead?"
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't the 'ead," said Sam.  "It was the
stummick."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parbury waved aside the objection as
unimportant.  "Well, any'ow 'e got two o' the
best for it, and it were while 'e were doin' 'is bit in
the Scrubs as 'e come across the doctor.  'E were a
clever sort o' chap were this 'ere doctor, but some'ow
'e'd gone the pace a bit too 'ot, an' got 'isself
in for forgery, see?
</p>

<p>
"They shoved 'im in the cell next to Spikey Joe,
the bloke wot 'ad been there previous 'avin' been
took bad with the cholera, and sent off to the
'orspital.  The fact were as 'e'd been bit by a
microbe in 'is sleep, but o' course the warders
didn't know nothin' about that, 'cause, 'aving
been asleep at the time, 'e didn't know it 'isself.
So, without meanin' no 'arm, they goes and shoves
the doctor in there in 'is place.
</p>

<p>
"Well, one night this doctor were a-settin' quiet
on 'is plank bed, thinkin' 'ow nice it would be when
'is time were up, when all of a sudden out pops
the microbe.  'E'd found out as there were someone
fresh in the cell, an' it seemed to 'im that 'e
might as well 'ave a bite at this cove same as
t'other one.  Course, 'e 'adn't no idea as 'ow it
were a doctor, or 'e'd 'a' laid low.  D'rectly 'e
come out 'e sees 'is mistake, an' stops as if 'e were
paralyzed.
</p>

<p>
"'Stead o' jumpin' up an' gettin' flustered, same
as you or me might do if we run across a microbe
unexpected like, the doctor 'e just sits there an'
smiles to 'isself.  Ye see, 'e'd 'andled 'undreds of
'em in 'is time, an' knew wot to do.
</p>

<p>
"'Come 'ere,' 'e says, fixin' 'im stern like with 'is
eye, an' as soon as ever 'e spoke the microbe come
to 'im as quiet as a lamb an' tremblin' all over.
'E saw as 'ow 'e'd met 'is master.
</p>

<p>
"Now the doctor were a soft-'earted sort o'
chap, and 'e kind o' took to that microbe from the
first.  In about a week 'e'd made a reg'lar pet of it.
When the warder wot brought 'im 'is dinner 'ad
gone away an' shut the door cell, 'e'd give a gentle
whistle, an' the microbe'd come 'oppin' out of its
'ole as friendly as yer please.  It used to climb
up 'is leg an' sit on 'is knee while 'e 'ad 'is dinner,
an' 'e'd always leave a little drop o' skilly for it at
the bottom o' the bowl.  When it 'ad lapped that
up, 'e'd sit there an' scratch 'is 'ead, same as if it
were a cat or a dog."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't it never 'ave a snap at 'im?" inquired Sam.
</p>

<p>
"Not it," retorted Mr. Parbury.  "Why, it
were that contented an' 'appy that Joe used to 'ear
it purrin' through the wall.  If it 'adn't been for
one o' the warders, there wouldn't never 'ave been
no trouble at all.  This 'ere warder&mdash;Jackson 'is
name was&mdash;were wot they calls a Socialist.  'E
'ated the very sight of a nob, consekence o' which
'e were always 'avin' 'is knife into the doctor.
One evenin' 'e was a-goin' on 'is rounds when 'e
'eard the microbe purrin' inside the doctor's cell.
So 'e kneels down, an' 'as a squint through the
peep'ole.  There 'e sees the doctor with the microbe
on 'is knee, tryin' to teach it to sit up and beg.
</p>

<p>
"'Wotcher got there,' 'e says, openin' the door
sudden, 'a rat?'
</p>

<p>
"'No,' says the doctor, without so much as
lookin' up.  ''E's a microbe&mdash;a cholera microbe.'
</p>

<p>
"Bein' a hunedjicated sort o' bloke, the warder
thought as 'ow 'e were bein' got at.
</p>

<p>
"'Ho! a cholera microbe, is 'e?' 'e says, very
sarcastic.  'Well per'aps when you've quite done
with 'im, you'll be kind enough to 'and 'im over to
me.  We don't allow no pets in this 'ere prison.
You'll be reported for this&mdash;that's wot you'll be.'
</p>

<p>
"'Don't get excited about it,' says the doctor,
quite cool, 'or you'll bust your 'eart&mdash;that's wot
you'll do.'
</p>

<p>
"'I'll teach yer to give me any o' your lip,' says
the warder, steppin' forward an' liftin' up 'is 'and
threatenin' like.
</p>

<p>
"Afore 'e could so much as wink, the microbe
gives one 'orrid sort o' snarl, and springs straight
at 'is throat like a blood'ound.  'E sees it comin',
and flings up the other 'and to guard 'isself.  'E
were on'y just in time, too, for the microbe's teeth
come together with a snap wot took the top clean
off 'is little finger."
</p>

<p>
"Wot! clean orf?" interrupted Bill incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"As clean as if it 'ad been cut with a knife,"
repeated Mr. Parbury firmly.  "The warder 'e
turns round with a yell o' terror an' makes a bolt for
the door.  As 'e slams it be'ind 'im 'e 'ears the
doctor a-laughin' fit to die, an' tellin' the microbe
to drop the bit of finger wot 'e 'ad in 's mouth.
'E goes straight orf to the 'ead warder as 'ard as
ever 'e can lick.  'Look 'ere!' 'e says, 'oldin' up 'is
finger, or rather wot were left of it.
</p>

<p>
"'Been cuttin' bread an' butter, Jackson?' says
the 'ead warder, wot fancied 'isself as a wit.
</p>

<p>
"'No I ain't,' says Jackson, a bit unpleasant
like.  (Bein' a Socialist, ye see, 'e 'adn't got much
sense of humour.)  'It's that there microbe o'
B24's,' 'e adds, 'and afore I go near 'im again I'll see
myself and the 'ole bloomin' prison busted, I will.'
</p>

<p>
"'Wot are yer talkin' about?' says the 'ead warder.
</p>

<p>
"Then Jackson tells 'im all about 'ow it 'appened
jest slippin' in a little bit 'ere and there to make
it more impressive-like.  'Talk about tigers,' 'e
finishes, 'why 'e come at me like a ragin' cyclone.
If I 'adn't kep' cool an' landed 'im one on the snout
I b'lieve 'e'd 'a' tore my windpipe out.'
</p>

<p>
"'An' wot were B24 a-doin' while the melly
were in progress?' said the 'ead warder, takin' out
'is notebook."
</p>

<p>
"While the wot were in progress?" interrupted
Bill and Sam at the same moment.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parbury looked at them pityingly.  "That's
Eytalion for a scrap," he explained.  "'Doin' of?'
repeated Jackson, 'why, 'e were a-cheerin' of 'im
on.  I tells you they're 'and in glove together&mdash;that's
wot they are&mdash;'and in glove.  If ye don't
believe me come an' 'ave a look at 'em yourself.'
</p>

<p>
"'Not me,' says the 'ead warder.  'I don't want
no tops bitten orf my fingers.  This 'ere's a case
for the guv'nor, this is.'
</p>

<p>
"So as soon as ever Jackson 'ad 'ad 'is 'and tied
up proper, 'e and the 'ead warder goes along to the
gov'nor's room.  'E were a retired colonel, were
this 'ere guv'nor, an' Spikey Joe says as 'ow 'is
language were that 'ot at times as even the convicts
useter shiver to 'ear it.
</p>

<p>
"'Well,' 'e says, when 'e sees the 'ead warder
and Jackson, 'wot the blazes is up now?  Can't I
never 'ave no peace?'
</p>

<p>
"The 'ead warder 'e salutes.  'Beg pardon, sir,'
'e says, 'but Jackson 'ere's just lost the top of 'is
little finger.'
</p>

<p>
"'Well, I 'aven't got the damned thing,' shouts
the guv'nor.  'Wot's the good 'o comin' to me?'
</p>

<p>
"'It's a matter o' Gov'rnment property,' says
the 'ead warder, 'an' accordin' to the regulations I
'as to account for its loss.'
</p>

<p>
"'Account for it then,' says the guv'nor, 'an'
don't stand there like a couple o' blistered
idjuts.'
</p>

<p>
"Then Jackson 'e ups an' tells 'is story again,
makin' out this time as 'ow 'e'd fought that
microbe for a matter o' ten minutes until the doctor
'ad begun clubbin' 'im over the 'ead from be'ind
with a boot.
</p>

<p>
"'I'll soon put a stop to this sort o' thing,' says
the guv'nor hotly, as soon as 'e'd finished.  'I
ain't goin' to 'ave none of 'is Majesty's prisons
bossed by no bloomin' microbe.  You run along
an' fetch 'em both 'ere, an' look sharp about it.'
</p>

<p>
"The 'ead warder 'e turns to the second warder.
'Jackson,' 'e says, 'go and fetch B24, and see that
'e brings the microbe along with 'im.'
</p>

<p>
"The second warder shifts uneasy-like from one
foot to the other.
</p>

<p>
"'Well, wot are ye waitin' for?' says the 'ead
warder very fierce.  'Are yer afraid?'
</p>

<p>
"'I ain't afraid o' no convict,' says the second
warder sulkily, 'but I don't fancy tacklin' this 'ere
microbe again, an' that's straight.'
</p>

<p>
"'You hear that, sir?' says the 'ead warder,
turnin' to the guv'nor.  ''E's a coward!'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, well,' says the guv'nor, 'it's very nachural
in a hunedjicated man.  You fetch 'im yourself,
Simpson.'
</p>

<p>
"The 'ead warder turns a bit pale.  ''Ave you
thought, sir,' he says, 'as 'ow it may be dangerous
bringin' of 'em in 'ere?  'E's a desperate character,
this B24, an' 'e might set the microbe at you, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"The guv'nor draws 'isself up proudly.  'A
English orficer ain't afraid o' no darn microbe,' 'e
says.  'You go along an' fetch 'im.'
</p>

<p>
"The second warder smiles.
</p>

<p>
"'An' you go with 'im,' says the guv'nor, 'an'
'urry up, the pair of yer.'
</p>

<p>
"The 'ead warder an' Jackson salutes, an' goes
out o' the room lookin' about as 'appy as a pair o'
blokes a-marchin' orf to the gallows.
</p>

<p>
"Jest afore they gets to the door o' the cell, the
'ead warder lays 'is 'and on Jackson's shoulder.
'Jackson,' says 'e, 'one of us 'as got to open this
'ere door.'
</p>

<p>
"Jackson nods 'is 'ead, and puts 'is uninjured
'and into 'is pocket.  'That's so,' says 'e.
</p>

<p>
"'Jackson,' says the 'ead warder again, an' 'is
voice shook like a haspen tree, 'Jackson, I'm a
married man.'
</p>

<p>
"'I knows that,' says Jackson softly.  'An'
'avin' seen your missus, I can understand 'ow it is
you don't mind takin' a few risks.'
</p>

<p>
"'You ain't doin' yourself no good by bein'
insolent,' says the 'ead warder 'otly.  'You go and
open that there door, or you'll be losin' your job
afore ye're many minutes older.'
</p>

<p>
"''Tain't my business to open the door,' says
Jackson in an obstinate voice.  'You're the 'ead
warder, an' you 'as a right to the post of danger.
Besides, maybe the microbe won't bite you.  'E
looks a bit partikler.'
</p>

<p>
"The 'ead warder gets very red in the face an'
breathes 'ard through 'is nose.  'If I 'ad you outside
the prison, my lad,' 'e begins, an' then rememberin'
'is position 'e pulls 'isself together, an' walks
orf towards the door o' the cell.
</p>

<p>
"'E were that there riled that 'e as near as
possible turned the key 'an went in without realizin'
wot 'e were playin' at.  Jest as 'e 'ad 'is 'and on the
door, 'owever, 'e suddenly comes to 'is senses, an'
I tells yer it give 'im a fair shiver all over to think
'ow near 'e'd been to doin' it.  'E bends down 'is
'ead an' listens, an' 'e 'ears the microbe a-grindin'
of 'is teeth an' the doctor tryin' to quiet 'im down.
</p>

<p>
"'B24,' says 'e, rappin' at the door, an' tryin' to
keep 'is voice steady.
</p>

<p>
"'I b'lieve I 'ave that honour,' says the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"'The guv'nor wishes to see yer immedjut.'
</p>

<p>
"'How! does 'e?' says the doctor, 'that shows 'is
good taste.'
</p>

<p>
"The 'ead warder 'esitates a moment.  'If I
opens this door,' says 'e, 'will yer promise to keep
that there microbe o' yourn from flyin' at me?'
</p>

<p>
"The doctor laughs 'earty.  ''E won't touch yer
if yer don't worry 'im,' 'e says.  'Jest keep that
lop-eared Jackson out o' the light, an' turn yer own
face away, an' 'e'll be as quiet as a lamb, won't yer,
old boy?'
</p>

<p>
"The microbe gives a kind o' snarl, much as to
say 'e weren't so sure about it.
</p>

<p>
"Seein' as 'ow the guv'nor were waitin', 'owever,
and there weren't no 'elp for it, the 'ead warder
turns the key an' pushes open the door o' the cell.
Jackson e' takes a couple o' 'asty steps down a side
passage, an' out comes the doctor with the microbe
a-sittin' on 'is shoulder.  When 'e sees the 'ead
warder 'e fair chatters with rage."
</p>

<p>
"Who does," asks Sam, "the doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the microbe, o' course," answered Mr. Parbury;
"an' wot's more, if yer goes on interruptin'
yer can finish the bloomin' story yerself."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind old Sam, Mr. Parbury," put in Bill
consolingly.  "'E don't never get no chanst to
open 'is mouth at 'ome, so 'e 'as to let a bit of steam
off when 'e's out."
</p>

<p>
Sam was just thinking hard of something
unpleasant to say in return, when Mr. Parbury
again took up the thread of his narrative.
</p>

<p>
"The doctor follows the 'ead warder along the
passages to the guv'nor's room, Jackson comin'
along slowly some ten yards be'ind.  All the time
the microbe kep' on grindin' of 'is teeth and lickin'
of 'is lips in a way that made the 'ead warder's
'eart jump up an' down like a piston-rod.  At last
they reaches the guv'nor's room, an' the 'ead
warder felt as if 'e'd got to 'Eaven.  'E gives a
couple of quiet knocks an' then steps 'astily aside.
</p>

<p>
"'Come in,' sings out the guv'nor.
</p>

<p>
"The doctor pushes open the door an' walks into
the room.  The 'ead warder an' Jackson follows
behind, tryin' to look as if they'd just let go of 'im.
'B24, sir,' says the 'ead warder, salutin'; 'an' the
microbe,' 'e adds as a kinder afterthought.
</p>

<p>
"The guv'nor was standing by the window with
one 'and under 'is coat.
</p>

<p>
"'Ho!' says 'e, 'so you're the fellow wot's
upsettin' o' my prison and bitin' orf my warder's
fingers, eh?'
</p>

<p>
"'Not guilty, colonel,' says the doctor, laughin'
as cool an' friendly as if 'e'd just dropped into 'ave
a drink.  'It's our little friend 'ere,' an' 'e pats the
microbe's head.  'I only 'ope 'e 'asn't poisoned
'isself,' 'e finishes, lookin' at Jackson.
</p>

<p>
"'Well, I can't 'ave it,' says the guv'nor.  'Warders
are Gov'rnment property, an' as such I'm
responsible for 'em to the 'Ome Secret'ry.  Besides
it's against the prison reg'lations for prisoners to
'ave pets.  Take it away from 'im, Simpson.'
</p>

<p>
"The 'ead warder goes very white, but 'e shuts
'is eyes for a second an' thinks of 'is pension, an'
some'ow or other 'is courage come back to 'im.
'E takes one step forward, but as 'e does so, the
microbe gives a angry kinder squeal an' leaps orf
the doctor's shoulder straight at the guv'nor.  The
old man sees it comin', an' quick as a flash, 'e whips
out a squisher from under 'is coat."
</p>

<p>
"Wot's a squisher?" asked Bill.
</p>

<p>
"Why, one o' them bottles with a toobe an' a
hinjarubber bulb.  Y' see, bein' a hedjicated man,
the guv'nor knew as 'ow there was only one way o'
dealin' with a microbe an' that were kerbolic acid.
One drop of kerbolic acid will lay out the 'ealthiest
microbe&mdash;stops 'is 'eart at once.  So while the 'ead
warder an' Jackson 'ad been out o' the room, 'e'd
gone an' got a squisher an' filled it up with kerbolic
acid in case of accidents.  D'rectly 'e sees the
microbe comin' for 'im, 'e whips it out an' lets
drive.  But the microbe were that cunning that
when 'e sniffs the kerbolic acid 'e shuts 'is wings
an' drops on the floor like a stone.  The kerbolic
acid goes over 'is 'ead an' as near as possible 'its
Jackson in the eye.  Then, afore the guv'nor
could get in a second squish, the microbe nips in
an' 'as 'im by the calf o' the leg.
</p>

<p>
"It 'ad all 'appened so sudden-like that the 'ead
warder an' Jackson were fair took by surprise.
D'rectly they sees the microbe catch 'old of the
guv'nor, 'owever, they both dashes forward an'
seizes the doctor.  The guv'nor were 'oppin'
round the room tryin' to get in a second shot with
the squisher, an' cussin' an' swearin' something
awful.  Spikey Joe says from the samples of 'is
language as reached the cells it's a marvel the
microbe didn't drop 'is jaw and let go.
</p>

<p>
"'Call 'im orf&mdash;call 'im orf,' 'e shouts to the
doctor.
</p>

<p>
"'Well, call your microbes orf,' says the doctor,
alludin' rude-like to Jackson and the 'ead warder.
</p>

<p>
"'Let go of 'im, you idjuts!' roars the guv'nor,
'oldin' on to the table an' tryin' to kick the microbe
with 'is other foot.
</p>

<p>
"They drops the doctor's arms, an' 'e starts
rearrangin' the collar of 'is coat.
</p>

<p>
"''Urry up!  'Urry up, man!' yells the guv'nor.
</p>

<p>
"'All right,' says the doctor coolly.  ''Ere,
Cholera!  Cholera!'
</p>

<p>
"As soon as 'e calls, the microbe, wot all the
time 'ad been 'angin' on like grim death, lets go 'is
grip, an' comes 'oppin' back to 'im, waggin' of 'is
tail an' purrin' like anything."
</p>

<p>
"But why did 'e let go when the doctor says
'Collar 'er'?" objected Sam; "that would 'ave
made 'im 'ang on all the 'arder."
</p>

<p>
"Not collar 'er, stupid," retorted Mr. Parbury
impatiently; "cholera&mdash;see?  Cholera microbe!"
</p>

<p>
"'Ow!  I see&mdash;'is name like."
</p>

<p>
"Jest so," assented Mr. Parbury.  "Well, when
Jackson an' the 'ead warder sees the microbe
comin' back, they lets go the doctor an' runs to 'elp
the guv'nor.
</p>

<p>
"'Don't come messin' about me,' yells the guv'nor.
'One of yer ketch 'old o' that ruffian, an' the
other fetch the prison doctor.'
</p>

<p>
"'E's away for the day, sir,' says the 'ead
warder.  'Shall I go outside and find another for
yer?  Jackson'll 'old on to B24.'
</p>

<p>
"''Tain't no use,' says the doctor, breakin' in
with a 'orrid sorter laugh.  ''E'll be too late.
Ye'll both 'ave the cholera in 'alf an hour unless I
gives yer the hantydote.'"
</p>

<p>
"Wot's that?" demanded Sam.
</p>

<p>
"Kinder secret medicine," explained Mr. Parbury.
"Jest like each microbe's got 'is special
poison, so each poison's got 'is special hantydote.
Bein', as I said afore, a hedjicated man, the
guv'nor sees the force of wot the doctor says.
</p>

<p>
"'Ye wouldn't murder us, man?' he says.
</p>

<p>
"'I ain't got no grudge against you,' answers the
doctor.  'If ye promises me on yer word as a
English orficer yell let me keep the microbe an'
won't take no further notice o' this hincident, I'll
save yer life.'
</p>

<p>
"'An' wot about me?' cried Jackson, as was
already beginnin' to feel a bit un'appy like inside.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, you'll 'ave to go through it.'
</p>

<p>
"Jackson busts out a-sobbin', and the guv'nor
draws 'isself up proud.
</p>

<p>
"'A English orficer don't desert 'is subordinates,'
'e says.  'You must attend to 'im, too&mdash;after you
done me.'
</p>

<p>
"'Right y'are,' says the doctor; 'in that case
you'll 'ave to put in a application to 'ave my
sentence rejooced.'
</p>

<p>
"'I'll see you 'ung first,' shouts the guv'nor.
</p>

<p>
"The doctor shakes 'is 'ead.  'I may be 'ung,' 'e
says, 'but you won't see it.  You'll be in the
morchury.'
</p>

<p>
"The guv'nor starts explaining as a English
orficer weren't afeared o' death but the doctor
cuts 'im short by pointin' out that every minute 'e
were talkin, the cholera were gettin' a better grip
on 'im.
</p>

<p>
"That settles it, and they all goes orf to the
prison surgery&mdash;the 'ead warder 'elpin' Jackson,
an' askin' 'im kind like whether there weren't no
messages 'e could give for 'im after 'e was dead."
</p>

<p>
"Time, gentlemen, please&mdash;time!"  The gruff
voice of the landlord broke in rudely.
</p>

<p>
"That's always the way," remarked Bill bitterly,
"jest as ye're gettin' interested in the
conversation."
</p>

<p>
"But wot 'appened?" demanded Sam eagerly.
"Did 'e cure 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"'E cured 'em right enough," replied Mr. Parbury.
"Leastways 'e cured the guv'nor.  Jackson
'ad a go o' cholera, but 'e managed to pull
through."
</p>

<p>
"And did the guv'nor get 'is sentence rejooced?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parbury carefully finished the contents of
his tankard and replaced it on the bar.

<p>
"Yes," he said, "'e were a orficer an' a gentleman,
an' e' kep' 'is word.  'E told the 'Ome Secret'ry
as 'ow 'e thought it weren't right on the
grounds of 'ealth to keep the doctor in the prison.
'E didn't say 'oose 'ealth, so the 'Ome Secret'ry
nachrily thought 'e meant the doctor's, an' let 'im
go."
</p>

<p>
"Now come along, gentlemen, <i>please</i>," repeated
the landlord impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Sam, as he rose slowly from his
seat; "it's a wunderful interestin' tale, as you say,
Mr. Parbury, an' it jest shows as 'ow it pays to be
kind to dumb animals."

<h3>
Full-back for England
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Very quietly the long reeds that hedged the
Okestock football field were parted aside, and a
face peered cautiously through, taking a long and
careful survey of the immediate neighbourhood.
The face belonged to Mr. William Yard, known to
his more intimate friends in London as "Pills,"
and to the police as one of the most daring and
successful burglars of the day.
</p>

<p>
A reason for Mr. Yard's prudence was not hard
to find: the briefest glance at his khaki-coloured
clothes, plentifully dotted with broad-arrows, made
it quite evident that for the time, at all events, any
form of publicity would be painful to him.
</p>

<p>
The fact was that on the previous afternoon
Mr. Yard had accomplished the remarkable feat of
escaping from Dartmoor.  An unexpected mist
sweeping down over the granite-studded hillside
when he was at work had suddenly inspired him
with the idea of making a dash for liberty.  Without
further thought he had flung down his spade and
bolted into its shelter, before either of the nearest
warders had been able to stop him.  It is true
that a couple of charges of buckshot had whistled
by, unpleasantly close to his legs, but they had
only served to add to his already useful turn of
speed.  By the time the other convicts had been
collected, and the mist had lifted sufficiently for
the warders to see what they were doing, Mr. Yard
was some two miles away in the opposite direction
from which he had started, safely hidden in a
small plantation that fringed the main road to
Okestock.
</p>

<p>
Here he had stayed until nightfall, expecting any
minute to be routed out by a party of pursuing
warders.  No one had turned up, however, his
ingenious idea of throwing a circle while the mist
still concealed him having apparently put them
temporarily off the scent.
</p>

<p>
Under cover of darkness he had stolen from his
hiding-place, and, following the main road at a
judicious distance, tramped doggedly on mile after
mile, until the lights of Okestock some hundred
feet below him had shown him that he had reached
the boundaries of the moor.
</p>

<p>
Utterly dead beat, he had felt tempted to throw
himself down on the open heather and snatch a
few hours' rest.  But the dread of discovery had
urged him on, and, clambering cautiously down the
hillside, he had made his way along the deserted
road until he had reached the wire fence which
bounded the Okestock football ground.  Here
a stray gleam of moonlight coming out between the
clouds had shown him the patch of long, reedy
grass behind the goal-posts.  With a last effort he
had crept into its shelter, and dropped almost
instantly into a profound sleep.
</p>

<p>
It was the sun which had woke him up eventually,
a bright yellow winter sun shining down out
of a sky of cloudless blue.  For a moment
Mr. Yard had rubbed his eyes and stared at it with
amazement; then with a sudden shock he had
remembered he was no longer a guest of the
Government.  He had tried to scramble up, but his
numbed limbs had refused to support him, and
with a groan he had fallen back again, feeling
rather like a trapped rabbit waiting the arrival of
the keeper.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes' energetic rubbing, however, had
been sufficient to restore both his circulation and
his confidence, and it was then that he had pulled
aside the reeds and peered out in the discreet
manner already described.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that met his eyes was the football
pavilion, a small wooden building on the left of
the ground.  Instantly the possibilities of a change
of clothes jumped into his mind.
</p>

<p>
"There's bound to be some clobber kicking
about in there," he muttered to himself.
"Wonder if I can get in without bein' nabbed?"
</p>

<p>
That, as Hamlet would have said, was the
question.  The public road, as he remembered
from last night, ran right alongside the ground,
and, to judge by the sun, the time was already
past ten o'clock.  Still, it was no good lying like a
hunted rat among the reeds.  It was a case of neck
or nothing, and Mr. Yard was not the man to fail
at a crisis.
</p>

<p>
Licking his blue lips, he raised himself to a
crouching position, and then, with a care which
would have done credit to a boy scout, elevated his
head above the top of the reeds.
</p>

<p>
So far as he could see in each direction, the road
was empty.  Hesitating no longer, he crept out
from his hiding-place, and, bending almost double,
covered the distance between the goal and the
pavilion in almost the same time that it takes to
read these words.
</p>

<p>
The door was in front, facing the yard; but
Mr. Yard did not trouble about this recognized means
of entrance.  He hurried round to the back, where
he found a small window just large enough to
admit a man's body.  It was shut, of course; but
this was a trifling obstacle to a gentleman of his
experience.  In about half a minute he had forced
it open, and, pulling himself up by the sill,
scrambled through and dropped on to the floor.
</p>

<p>
He found himself in a small matchboard
apartment, set round with wooden lockers.  There
were also various pegs from which were suspended
one or two mud-stained jerseys and sweaters, an
old greatcoat, and a couple of pairs of blue football
shorts, distinctly the worse for wear.
</p>

<p>
To Mr. Yard's eyes, however, they were more
welcome and attractive than the flowers in May.
Stripping himself of his broad-arrowed costume
with feverish rapidity, he hastily arrayed himself
in the somewhat less conspicuous costume of a
British footballer, minus the stockings and boots.
A hurried search through the lockers revealed
both these luxuries, with the aid of which he
promptly proceeded to complete his outfit.
</p>

<p>
"Lor!" he chuckled, surveying himself with
satisfaction in the broken bit of looking-glass that
hung from the wall.  "I never thought I should be
wearin' footer kit again.  It's like old days!"
</p>

<p>
There was no time for sentiment, however, and
Mr. Yard was not slow in realizing the fact.
Grabbing the greatcoat from its peg, he was just about
to make for the window, when a sudden shout
outside brought him to an abrupt halt.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Tubby!" sang out a cheery voice.
</p>

<p>
Like a cat Mr. Yard stole to the window.  Some
thirty yards away a young man with a bag in his
hand was advancing towards the pavilion across
the next field.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly and noiselessly the convict crossed the
floor to the other side of the apartment, and peeped
through a crack in the boards.  Another young
man with another bag in his hand was approaching
from the roadway.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard swore, softly but fervently.
</p>

<p>
"Pipped!" he said; "pipped on the post!"
</p>

<p>
For a second he hesitated, and then returning
to the spot where he had dressed, picked up his
late garments and stuffed them into one of the
lockers and shut the lid.
</p>

<p>
Having done this he sat down and waited events.
</p>

<p>
"I've got the key, Tubby!" called out the same
aggressively jovial voice.
</p>

<p>
"Right-oh!" responded the other.  "D'you
know this bally window's open?"
</p>

<p>
There was a grating in the lock.
</p>

<p>
"That's that old ass Smith again!" said the
cheerful voice.  "I told him to shut it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard rose to his feet.  If he had to be
captured he would at least enjoy the memory of
one really magnificent scrap.  There was a sharp
click, a bump, and then the door swung open.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" exclaimed the young man with the bag.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" returned Mr. Yard coolly.
</p>

<p>
The newcomer stared at him for a moment in
amazement, and then, with a sudden smile, put
down his bag and advanced towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Logan, I suppose," he said.  "This is
awfully good of you.  I'd just made up my mind
we should have to play one short."
</p>

<p>
He put out his hand, which Mr. Yard grasped
and shook heartily.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the other young man entered.
</p>

<p>
"This is Logan, Tubby!" exclaimed the first.
"He's turned up, after all."
</p>

<p>
"Good man!" exclaimed Tubby.  "But how
the dickens did you get in?"
</p>

<p>
"Through the window," explained Mr. Yard
truthfully.
</p>

<p>
"That's the style," laughed the other.  "Jack,
why weren't you here to receive your guests?  I
suppose you came over in Sam's cart?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard, who was trying desperately hard to
get his bearings, contented himself with a nod.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm most awfly obliged to you for
turning up," said Jack.  "Old Morton had heard you
were at Rundlestone, and suggested my sending
you a wire first thing this morning, when Collins
cried off.  I never thought you'd be able to come."
</p>

<p>
"It was just chance," admitted Mr. Yard
frankly.  "I got away unexpected."
</p>

<p>
"We're jolly glad to see you, anyhow," broke in
Tubby.  "The Battery are sending over a beastly
hot team, and we should have been absolutely
snookered without a back."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard suppressed a start.  In more innocent
days, before the stern career of burglary had
claimed him for its own, he had figured as a
fullback of some local renown for a famous Yorkshire
club.  And now apparently it was in the same
capacity that he was being so hospitably received
by these two unsuspicious young men.  Who the
missing Logan might be he could only guess.
Evidently some well-known player who was staying
in the district, and had been invited over to
assist Okestock at the eleventh hour.  "If he
turns up," thought Mr. Yard, "things'll be a bit
hot."
</p>

<p>
His reflections were broken in upon by Jack.
</p>

<p>
"These morning matches are the deuce, you
know, Logan.  Half our fellows are in business,
and it's a rare job to get a team together."
</p>

<p>
"One can't always get off when one wants to,"
said Mr. Yard sympathetically; "I've found that
meself."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't have taken them on," continued
the other, stripping off his shirt, and groping in his
bag for a jersey, "if it hadn't been that they're
leaving Plymouth on Friday.  The Colonel was
very keen to have a cut at us first, as we haven't
been beaten this year.  The old beggar thought
he'd catch us on the hop if he could fix up a
mid-week match.  He'll be awfully sick when he finds
you're playing for us.  I expect there are a lot of
people after you when you're on a holiday, aren't
there?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite enough," confessed Mr. Yard.
</p>

<p>
A sudden sound of laughter and voices outside
became audible, and Tubby, walking to the door,
flung it open.
</p>

<p>
"Here are the others!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Some seven or eight young fellows, most of them
already changed, came straggling across the field.
When they saw Tubby at the door they raised a
cheerful "Coo-ee!"
</p>

<p>
"The Campbells are coming!" called out one.
</p>

<p>
The words had hardly left his lips when a big
brake, packed with men, rumbled along the road
and drew up at the entrance to the ground.
</p>

<p>
As the soldiers were disembarking themselves,
Mr. Yard was being introduced to the new arrivals
on his own side.  On every hand he was greeted
with the warmest of welcomes.
</p>

<p>
"I saw you play a couple of years ago for
Devon," said one youngster admiringly.  "My
word, you were in form!  Hadn't you a moustache
then, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I had it shaved off last year," he said.
</p>

<p>
By this time the slightly mistaken impression as
to his identity had become public property, and
the visitors, who had all arrived in their footer kit,
were standing about viewing him with mingled
expressions of curiosity and respect.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel, who had brought the Battery over,
a jolly-looking, fat old man with a white
moustache, came up and introduced himself.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to have the chance of seeing you play,
Mr. Logan," he said, "but it's a low-down trick of
young Mortimer here roping you in.  We weren't
expecting to run up against an International fullback."
</p>

<p>
"You'll run up against him all right," interrupted
Jack, with a laugh.  "That's what he's
here for."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard, who was beginning to get a little
nervous about his growing reputation, smiled
uneasily.  He had not played for at least five
years, and although, thanks to the healthy
limitations of Dartmoor, he was in excellent condition,
he could not help feeling grave doubts as to
whether he would be able to live up to Mr. Logan's
formidable fame.  However, there was nothing to
do now but to go through with it.
</p>

<p>
Tubby, fully changed, came running out from
the pavilion with a ball, followed by several other
members of the team.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are," he sang out, passing it to Yard;
"have a shot at goal!"
</p>

<p>
The convict caught the leather, and somehow
or other the once-familiar feel of it restored his
waning spirits.  Taking a couple of short steps, he
sent it soaring away towards the goal, a beautiful
drop-kick that only fell short of the crossbar by a
couple of inches.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" shouted Jack, gazing after it admiringly.
"What do you think of that, Colonel?"
</p>

<p>
"Too damned good altogether!" grunted the old
soldier.  "I shall take my boys back to barracks if
he does it again."
</p>

<p>
There was a general laugh, cut short by a sharp
whistle from the referee.
</p>

<p>
The two sides lined up.  As far as looks went
they seemed fairly equally matched, the superior
weight and strength of the soldiers in the scrum
being pretty well counterbalanced by the youth
and speedy appearance of the Okestock
three-quarters and halves.
</p>

<p>
From the solitary glory of his position at fullback,
Mr. Yard cast a critical eye over his opponents.
A tall, fair-haired man who was playing on
the right wing seemed especially to rivet his
attention.
</p>

<p>
"Who's that chap?" he asked Tubby, as the
latter fell back in preparation for the kick-off.
</p>

<p>
"Private Buckle," answered the latter, glancing
in the direction he indicated.  "You'll have to
look out for him; he's about their best man."
</p>

<p>
The full-back smiled unpleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"I'll look out for him all right," he answered.
</p>

<p>
For eighteen months Mr. Yard had been under
the immediate charge of a warder of the same name,
whose striking resemblance to the tall three-quarter
proclaimed their relationship beyond doubt.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard spat on his hands.
</p>

<p>
"I only hope they're twins," he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
Another sharp whistle, a general movement
forward amongst the line of stalwart soldiers, and
the ball came soaring through the air straight into
Tubby's hands.  The game had started.
</p>

<p>
For the first ten minutes the play remained more
or less confined to the centre of the ground.  The
Okestock forwards, settling down quicker than
their adversaries, were more than holding their
own in the scrum, and only the very keen tackling
of the soldier three-quarters prevented Tubby and
his companions from coming away with the ball.
</p>

<p>
At last the former got his chance.  Taking a
swift pass from the half, he cut right through the
opposition line, and dashed off down the field, with
only the back between himself and the goal.  As
the latter leaped at him, he transferred the ball
neatly to Jack, who was racing along a yard and a
half to his left.  Catching it in his stride, that
genial young man swerved round the disgruntled
soldier, and, galloping over the line, placed it fair
and square between the goal-posts.
</p>

<p>
Picking it up again, he leisurely retraced his
steps.  Some twenty yards out he halted, and
beckoned to Mr. Yard.
</p>

<p>
"Will you take the kick, Logan?" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard modestly shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you must!" protested three or four of
the others.  "We've all heard about your goal-kicking."
</p>

<p>
The whole field was waiting, and, seeing that
there was no help for it, Mr. Yard strode
reluctantly forward.
</p>

<p>
"Where would you like it?" inquired Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, any old place!" answered the unhappy
convict.  "This'll do."
</p>

<p>
He viciously dug out a hole with his heel.  Jack,
carefully poising the ball in his hands, stretched
himself out full length, and a painful moment of
silence prevailed over the field.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard retired two or three steps.
</p>

<p>
"Down!" he cried hoarsely; and then, running
forward, hacked at the ball with amazing ferocity.
Up it flew high over the crossbar, and, describing a
graceful curve in the air, settled down in the next
field.
</p>

<p>
There was a wild outburst of applause from the
delighted Okestock team; and Mr. Yard, mopping
his forehead with his sleeve, retired to his former
position.
</p>

<p>
"If I hadn't have said to myself it was a
warder's head," he muttered, "I'd never have
done it."
</p>

<p>
The game was resumed even more vigorously
than before.  Determined to draw level, the
soldiers hurled themselves into their task with
unsparing energy and their extra weight and
strength in the scrum began to tell its tale.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion four stalwart privates broke
right through the Okestock pack, and came
thundering down the field with the ball at their
feet.  A score seemed certain, but Mr. Yard,
whose arduous training as a burglar had taught
him the value of strategy, saved the situation.
Just as the quartette were drawing up to him, he
suddenly rasped out in excellent imitation of a
drill-sergeant the one magic word: "Halt!"
</p>

<p>
His opponents instinctively checked themselves,
and, before they could recover, Mr. Yard had
flung himself at the ball and with a flying kick sent
it hurtling into touch.
</p>

<p>
He was surprised, and for a moment alarmed, at
the indignation which his ingenious idea provoked
among its immediate victims.  All four of them
were appealing angrily to the referee, who, speechless
with laughter, could only shake his head and
sign to them to proceed.
</p>

<p>
It was not until Mr. Yard realized that even the
other members of the regimental team were hugely
enjoying their companions' discomfiture that his
fear lest he should have given himself away
completely vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Git on with the game, ye fat'eads," roared the
bully corporal who was skippering the team.
Then, turning to Jack, he added admiringly: "'Ot
stuff!  That's what 'e is&mdash;'ot stuff!"
</p>

<p>
Jack, who was struggling between mirth and
amazement, thought it wiser to say nothing.  A
moment later, however, finding himself alongside
of Tubby, he whispered hurriedly:
</p>

<p>
"I say, that was a bit thick, wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Tubby grinned.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers' revenge was not long in coming.
From the line-out one of them caught the ball, and
flung it back to the tall, fair-haired three-quarter,
who was standing unmarked.  In a moment the
latter had cut through and was galloping along the
touch-line towards the Okestock goal.
</p>

<p>
With a grunt of joy, Mr. Yard came hurrying
across, and leaped at his quarry like a tiger at a
stag.  In the splendour of his emotions, however,
he committed the unpardonable error of going a
shade too high.
</p>

<p>
The soldier's muscular hand shot out, and,
catching his assailant fair and square under the
chin, sent him spinning backwards on the grass.
Then, amidst roars of delight from his companions,
he ran round and deposited the ball half-way
between the goal-posts.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard sat up and looked after him.
</p>

<p>
"You swine!" he said softly.  "You wait!"
</p>

<p>
Jack and Tubby came hurrying up.
</p>

<p>
"Not hurt, Logan, are you?" inquired the
former anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Only in me feelings!" answered Mr. Yard.
</p>

<p>
Tubby laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's a new sensation for you to miss any
one!" he said, as they walked back towards the
goal.  "I always thought Buckle was a pretty stiff
proposition; now I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard made no audible answer.  To himself,
however, he remarked bitterly: "He'll be stiffer
still before I've done with him."
</p>

<p>
A successful place-kick put the two sides level,
and immediately afterwards the whistle went for
half-time.
</p>

<p>
When they resumed Mr. Yard had quite recovered
from the effects of his tumble.  He was standing
in his place, luxuriously pondering over his
next meeting with Private Buckle, when he
suddenly observed a telegraph-boy opening the gate
which led into the field.
</p>

<p>
Great minds work quickly.  In a flash, Mr. Yard
realized his danger.  It was a hundred to one
that the missing Logan had wired to explain his
absence.
</p>

<p>
Casting a hasty glance at the game, which gave
no sign of requiring his immediate services, he
hurried down to the touch-line and held out his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"For Mr. Mortimer, sir," said the lad.
</p>

<p>
"All right, my son," answered Mr. Yard pleasantly.
"I'll give it him."
</p>

<p>
The boy handed over the yellow envelope, and
then slowly began to retrace his steps, walking
backwards and keeping a longing eye on the game.
His own inclinations, fortunately for Mr. Yard,
were at variance with the Government's views as
to how long a telegraph-boy might take over a
message, and, seeing that the full-back had had no
opportunity as yet of passing on the wire, he at
length vanished round the corner, unsuspicious as
to its ultimate delivery.
</p>

<p>
It was not until he had completely disappeared
that Mr. Yard opened the envelope.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry can't play to-day.  Away last night;
only just received letter.&mdash;LOGAN."
</p>

<p>
The convict barely had time to master the
message when a sudden shout of "Look out,
there!" recalled him abruptly to his environment.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers' three-quarters were in full movement;
the ball travelling neatly up the line toward
the right wing.
</p>

<p>
It finally came to rest in the hands of Private
Buckle, who, avoiding the well-meant but somewhat
belated attentions of Jack, came racing away
down the touch-line.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard almost sobbed with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
He darted across the ground, timing his arrival
to perfection.  The three-quarter saw him coming,
and, shifting the ball to his right arm, prepared to
repeat his successful hand-off.  But, like many
other good intentions, his purpose was destined
never to bear fruit.
</p>

<p>
Dropping his bullet head, Mr. Yard propelled
himself through the air on the lines of a Whitehead
torpedo, and with an appalling crash the two
men hurtled to the ground and rolled over, locked
in each other's arms.
</p>

<p>
"Gad, what a collar!" roared Jack, as the ball,
after leaping high into the air, dropped safely into
touch.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard was the first to rise.  In that exquisite
moment he seemed to have worked off all the
bottled resentment of eighteen soul-searing months.
</p>

<p>
"Hope you're not hurt?" he grinned, extending a
hand to the unfortunate Buckle, who lay on the
ground gasping like a recently landed salmon.
</p>

<p>
The latter accepted it, and scrambled painfully
to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"'Urt!" he stammered ironically.  "Ho n-n-no,
I ain't 'urt!  I shouldn't a' known you'd
c-c-collared me if you 'adn't mentioned it."
</p>

<p>
There was a general laugh, which the corporal
capped by inquiring gravely:
</p>

<p>
"You don't 'appen to be wanting a job as a six-inch
shell, I s'pose, Mr. Logan?  We could do with
a few more."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I've had enough o' working for the Government!"
he remarked drily.
</p>

<p>
Only ten minutes more remained for play, and
the fun became fast and furious.  Both sides laid
themselves out to score, magnificently indifferent
to anything approaching defensive tactics.  On
one occasion Jack was hurled into touch when only
a couple of feet from the soldiers' line, while, on
another, nothing but an untimely stumble on the
part of the big corporal prevented that gentleman
from dribbling over and touching down.
</p>

<p>
It was left to Mr. Yard to put the crowning
touch on the day's work.  One minute from time
the Battery's full-back picked up the ball in front
of his own goal, and took a huge punt straight up
the field.  It dropped right into the hands of the
convict, who was standing in a line with the centre
flag.
</p>

<p>
The rushing forwards paused to give him five
yards' law, and Mr. Yard gripped the occasion
with commendable promptness.
</p>

<p>
Instead of kicking, he suddenly launched himself
forward right into the thick of his waiting
adversaries.  In a moment he had bullocked his way
through, his sudden run taking the opposition
utterly by surprise.
</p>

<p>
There was a roar of "Collar him!" and from both
sides the halves and three-quarters came thundering
in to cut off his advance.  Mr. Yard took in the
situation at a glance.  In a flash he had measured
the distance between himself and the goal, and
then, dropping the ball, sent it soaring away with
a terrific kick straight for the bar.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of painful silence.  The
ball pitched fair and square bang on the centre-piece,
bounded up into the air, and then trickled
gently over on the further side.
</p>

<p>
A howl of joy from the Okestock team, the
referee whistled, and the game was over.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard found himself surrounded by a throng
of his fellow-players, each endeavouring to outvie
the other in compliments and gratitude.  With a
sudden inspiration, he thrust his way through,
and made a dash for the pavilion.  It could not
have been more than forty-five seconds before the
foremost of his laughing pursuers ran in after him,
but that priceless interval had not been wasted.  In
Mr. Yard's breeches-pocket reposed practically the
entire stock of loose cash which had previously
enriched the hanging line of waistcoats and trousers.
</p>

<p>
"I must be off!" he said hastily, picking up his
adopted coat and cap.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang it all!" cried Jack.  "I was going to
suggest that you should come back and have some
lunch with us."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard shook his head.  The thought of
food was a very fragrant one, but the money in his
pocket clamoured for instant retreat.
</p>

<p>
"Can't," he said regretfully.  "It's uncommon
good of you, but I've got to get into Plymouth as
quickly as possible."
</p>

<p>
"Plymouth!" exclaimed the Colonel, who had
just come up.  "If you want to go to Plymouth
you'd better pack in with us.  We can drop you at
the Halfpenny Gate, and you can pick up a tram
from there."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!" said Mr. Yard gratefully.  "That'll
do me fine."
</p>

<p>
"Come along, then," said the Colonel; "we're
off right away."
</p>

<p>
"Will you be on the moor next Saturday?"
cried Jack, pressing forward with the others to
shake the hand of their parting guest.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite possible," admitted Mr. Yard.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'll come and play for us again, won't
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to," said Mr. Yard, "if I can get away."
</p>

<p>
He clambered into the brake with the soldiers,
and waved a parting farewell to his late colleagues,
who set up a ringing cheer as the big vehicle slowly
rumbled off.
</p>

<p>
"Good set of lads," said the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard, thoughtfully fingering the money in
his pocket, nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
The eight-mile drive into Plymouth was not
without its anxieties.  At every turn in the road
Mr. Yard half expected to find a mounted warder
holding up his hand to stop the horses.  No such
untimely incident, however, marred the harmony
of the day, and just as the clocks were striking
half-past one the brake was clattering through the
ill-paved, straggling streets of Devonport.
</p>

<p>
At the junction of Dockyard Road and Broadway,
Mr. Yard's eyes detected a second-hand
clothes shop of particularly disreputable aspect.
He waited until they reached the next corner, and
then, turning to the Colonel, remarked casually:
"This'll do all right for me; I want to get some
'baccy."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," said the Colonel, giving the
order to stop.  "You know where the bridge
is&mdash;first to the left, then straight on."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Yard nodded, and climbed out.  "Thank
ye for the lift," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," answered the Colonel.  "Delighted!
The Battery will always be proud to think that
they had the honour of playing against you and
scoring a try&mdash;eh, men?"
</p>

<p>
There was a general chorus of "Yes, sir," and a
hearty salute which Mr. Yard gracefully returned.
</p>

<p>
Then the driver cracked his whip, and the brake
rolled away, leaving Mr. Yard standing in the roadway.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was three days later, when Jack, folding up
the <i>Western Morning News</i>, tossed it across to
Tubby.
</p>

<p>
"There you are," he said, "pictures and everything.
We shall never hear the last of this as long
as we live."
</p>

<p>
Tubby caught the paper, and, unfolding it, read
out the heavily leaded headlines:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  ASTOUNDING AUDACITY OF ESCAPED CONVICT.<br />
  THE NOTORIOUS BILL YARD PLAYS<br />
  FOOTBALL FOR OKESTOCK<br />
  FULL STORY AND INTERVIEWS<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He skimmed quickly through the three columns
of description, and then, with a grin, dropped the
paper on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"We <i>do</i> look a pretty tidy lot of idiots," he
admitted.  "I wonder where he is?"
</p>

<p>
Jack shrugged his shoulders.  "So do the police.
They've no idea what happened to him after he got
the clothes.  He's simply vanished&mdash;disappeared,
and my ten shillings with him."  Then he paused.
"I only wish it had been a quid," he added.
</p>

<p>
"Mine was," said Tubby softly.
</p>

<h3>
Elsie and the Rooks
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was really a lovely afternoon; there was no
doubt about that.  Elsie felt very comfortable,
and just a little bit sleepy.  She was lying back in
the big chair under the cedar tree, which was the
most shady place in the whole garden.  On the
lawn the thrushes and sparrows were hopping
about enjoying the sunshine; while up at the top of
the tall elm trees the rooks were cawing away as if
they were all trying who could make the most
noise.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I knew what they were talking about,"
Elsie said to herself.  "It would be such fun to
shout up something in rook language, and see them
all jump.  I wonder what 'Caw!  Caw!  Caw!'
means!"
</p>

<p>
She had asked her big brother that very question
only the day before.  He had laughed, and
declared that the rooks didn't say "Caw!  Caw!
Caw!"  It only sounded like it.  What they really
said was "Cad!  Cad!  Cad!" because they knew
that he was going to shoot them next week.
</p>

<p>
Elsie didn't really believe this, because the rooks
kept on saying it the whole time, whether her
brother was in the garden or not.  Of course, they
might be only practising, but it seemed much more
probable to Elsie that they had a language of their
own.
</p>

<p>
She lay back in the chair and watched them as
they fluttered about the tree-tops, or rose in the air
in great sweeping circles.  In a few more days the
baby rooks would begin to fly about.  Several of
them were out of the nests already, and sat on the
twigs looking very miserable and unsafe, while
their fathers and mothers hovered round, and
jeered at them for being frightened.  Elsie thought
that it was very unkind of the old rooks; for she
was quite sure that it must be a horrible feeling to
be perched up at that height on a swaying twig,
and not certain whether one could fly if one let go.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't like it a bit myself," thought Elsie
dreamily.
</p>

<p>
With a big yawn she snuggled down amongst the
cushions, which were very soft and comfortable.
Her eyes would keep on shutting in the funniest
way, just as if it were bed-time.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;do&mdash;believe&mdash;I'm&mdash;going&mdash;to sleep," she
murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" said a harsh voice suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Elsie opened her eyes with a start, and looked
round to see who had spoken.  There was no one
in sight.
</p>

<p>
"I must have been dreaming," she thought.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" said the voice again&mdash;this time just
beside her chair.
</p>

<p>
She glanced down, and there on the lawn stood a
large rook, looking up at her out of his black, beady
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Did you speak?" asked Elsie in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the rook.  "Do you think I
whistled, or what?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no need to be rude," said Elsie with
dignity.  "It's only natural I should have been
surprised."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked the rook.
</p>

<p>
"Well, birds aren't supposed to talk."
</p>

<p>
"Ever seen a parrot?"
</p>

<p>
"You're not a parrot," objected Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Never said I was," replied the rook.  "But
you seem interested in us," he observed, "judging
from the way you were staring just now."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," said Elsie, blushing, for
she had been properly brought up, and knew that
it was rude to stare.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it," said the rook.  "I assure
you we don't mind in the least.  Wouldn't you
like to come up and have a look at the nests?"
</p>

<p>
"Very much," answered Elsie; "but how can I?
I can't climb the trees."
</p>

<p>
"If it comes to that," replied the rook, "neither
can I."
</p>

<p>
"But you can fly," objected Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"So can you, I suppose," said the rook.
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't," said Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" persisted the rook.
"Have you ever tried?"
</p>

<p>
Elsie shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly," she said.  "I know very well
I can't fly, so what's the good of trying?"
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly what our children always say,"
replied the rook scornfully.  "And yet they fly
right enough when we push them out of the nest."
</p>

<p>
He laughed a sort of hoarse, croaking chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, if you're afraid"&mdash;he added.
</p>

<p>
Elsie jumped up out of her chair indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Afraid?  Who's afraid?" she cried.  "You're
just saying that to annoy me!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not," answered the rook.  "Don't
get your feathers ruffled.  All you have to do is to
copy me, and you'll fly like a bird."
</p>

<p>
"But I haven't got any wings," said Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"You've got arms, haven't you?  They'll do
just as well for a short distance, and if you get
tired I'll lend you a claw.  Now, come along.
Just shut your eyes and jump, and you'll find
you're as right as rain."
</p>

<p>
Elsie thought that there could be no great harm
in trying, so she closed her eyes, and jumped up in
the air as high as ever she could.  Of course, she
expected to come down again bang, but to her
great surprise she did nothing of the kind.  She
found herself floating gently upwards, and, opening
her eyes, discovered that she was already on a
level with the roof of the house.  The rook was
fluttering lazily alongside.
</p>

<p>
"Don't look down," he said, "or you'll get
giddy.  Keep your eyes on the nests, and we'll
be there in no time.  How do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's very nice," said Elsie.  "I had no idea it
was so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She had just made a most startling discovery.
</p>

<p>
"I seem to be getting smaller and smaller!" she
exclaimed in a frightened voice.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally," answered the rook.  "Everything
does when it goes up in the air.  Haven't you
ever watched a balloon?"
</p>

<p>
"But you're just the same size," protested Elsie,
for by this time the rook was almost as big as
herself.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm used to it!" he answered carelessly.
"You see, after a bit, when one's always flying
about, it ceases to have any effect."
</p>

<p>
By this time they were getting quite near the
nests, and Elsie was beginning to feel rather
tired.
</p>

<p>
"We're nearly there now!" said the rook.
"Stick to it!"
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, a whole crowd of other rooks
suddenly rose from the trees, and came
circling down to meet them.  They made such a
tremendous noise that for a few moments Elsie
couldn't hear what they were saying.  At last,
however, she began to make out a sort of song;
but, as they were all singing it at once, and
each to a different tune, it was rather difficult
to follow the words.  It sounded something like
this:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Welcome to our brother Jim!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caw!  Caw!  Caw!<br />
  He's brought the little girl with him,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caw!  Caw!  Caw!<br />
  So clap your wings and loudly squeak;<br />
  There'll be no bang! bang! bang! next week!<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"What do they mean?" asked Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing!" said the rook hurriedly.  "It's
only their idea of a lark."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;don't&mdash;think&mdash;it's&mdash;very&mdash;like one," panted Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Here&mdash;take my claw," said the rook.  "You're
getting tired."
</p>

<p>
Elsie stretched out her hand and caught hold of
the rook's claw, which he held out to her, and
then, before she had quite realized what was
happening, she found herself sitting on a twig at
the very top of the tallest elm tree.  The branches
all round were simply covered with rooks, who sat
and stared at her solemnly.  Even the young ones
were peering over the edges of the nests, and
making rude remarks to each other about her
personal appearance.
</p>

<p>
She looked down at the garden, and it gave her
quite a jump to see what a terrible distance it was.
It seemed simply miles and miles away.  The
house looked just like one of those tiny little toy
dolls' houses.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the rook.  "How do you feel?"
</p>

<p>
Elsie clung to the twig, for it had suddenly
begun to sway about in the most alarming
manner.
</p>

<p>
"I feel very small," she answered nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally," said the rook.  "So do most
people when they're up a tree."
</p>

<p>
And all the other rooks went "Ha!  Ha!  Ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Does it always sway about like this?" asked
Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Whenever it blows," answered the rook calmly.
"Where there's a wind there's a sway.  But come
along and see the nests."
</p>

<p>
"How can I get there?" demanded Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Why, jump, of course!  It's quite easy."
</p>

<p>
"But I might fall," objected Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Are you proud?" asked the rook.
</p>

<p>
Elsie shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what that's got to do with it," she
remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't fall if you aren't proud.  Pride
goes before a fall, you know.  Now, don't be
nervous.  Jump when I say three; and we'll catch
you if you slip."
</p>

<p>
He counted out: "One, two, three," and, as he
said the last word, Elsie let go the twig and jumped
for the nearest nest.  It was a close shave, but she
just caught hold of the edge as she was falling,
and managed to draw herself up.
</p>

<p>
"Well done!" called out the rook.  "You ought
to have been a grasshopper."
</p>

<p>
"I think you're very rude," said Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"All our family are," replied the rook, fluttering
into the nest.  "We think it's clever.  But come
inside and see the children."
</p>

<p>
"What's that for?" asked Elsie, pointing up
above the nest.
</p>

<p>
She had suddenly caught sight of a kind of
round, wickerwork cover, which was fastened to
the nest by a hinge, and could apparently be shut
down like the lid of a box.
</p>

<p>
"That?" said the rook.  "Oh, that's the roof.
We have to have a roof because of the hawk.
Otherwise he would eat up the children."
</p>

<p>
"How horrid of him!" cried Elsie.
</p>

<p>
There were four little rooks in the nest, and when
they saw Elsie they all began to laugh in the rudest
possible way.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" asked one of them.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you pick it up, father?" inquired a
second.
</p>

<p>
"She's moulting!" exclaimed a third.
</p>

<p>
"Smart, aren't they?" said the rook admiringly,
turning to Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"One can see they're your children," retorted
Elsie, "because they've got such bad manners;
and now, if you don't mind, I think I ought to be
getting back.  It must be nearly tea-time."
</p>

<p>
"Getting back where?" asked the rook.
</p>

<p>
"Why, home, of course," answered Elsie.
</p>

<p>
The rook shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to disappoint you," he said, "but
I'm afraid you won't be able to go home for
another week at least."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" cried Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"It may be mean," said the rook, "but I can't
help it.  Your brother is going to shoot at us next
week, and if we've got you up here he won't be
able to&mdash;see?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Elsie.  "Then that was why you
invited me up?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course it was," replied the rook.  "You
don't suppose it was for the pleasure of your
society, do you?"
</p>

<p>
You can imagine Elsie's feelings when she
realized how she had been trapped.  She knew she
would never have the courage to try to fly down by
herself; and as for climbing&mdash;well, the very thought
made her giddy!  In despair she stood up, and
looked over the side of the nest.  Far, far down
below she saw her brother coming out into the
garden with his gun on his shoulder.  If only she
could make him hear!
</p>

<p>
"Jack!" she cried.  "Jack!"
</p>

<p>
She watched her voice going down, down, down;
but it only got about half the distance, and then
faded away.
</p>

<p>
"Try again," said the rook, with a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
But Elsie saw that it was no good; so she just sat
down on the side of the nest and began to cry.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever shall I do?" she said helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to grin and bear it," said the rook.
</p>

<p>
"It's no good blubbering," added one of the
young ones.
</p>

<p>
"Coward!" said a third scornfully.
</p>

<p>
And all the rooks who were sitting round went
"Yah!  Yah!  Yah!"
</p>

<p>
A moment later, however, one of them gave a
sudden scream of terror.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" he cried.  "The hawk!  The hawk!"
</p>

<p>
They all rose into the air in a great, flapping
crowd, and flew away to their nests to shut down
the covers before the hawk could reach them.
The rook who had enticed Elsie up at once hopped
across to close his own lid, but with one jump she
reached the hinge before he could touch it.
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't!" she cried.  "I'm not going to
be shut in your horrid, stuffy nest."
</p>

<p>
"Let go!" he shrieked, pecking at her furiously.
</p>

<p>
But although he hurt her very much, Elsie held
on.  She could hear the sound of the hawk's wings
as he came nearer and nearer, and at last, with one
hoarse cry of rage, the rook abandoned his efforts
and scuttled off as fast as ever he could go.
</p>

<p>
Elsie felt so tired that she could scarcely move.
She just sat down on the side of the nest, and
waited to see what would happen.  There was a
loud "whirr!" of wings, and then suddenly the
hawk dropped down from above like a stone, and
perched on a twig exactly opposite.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" he said.  "What's the meaning of this?"
</p>

<p>
Elsie looked up, and found him staring at her
with his bright brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mister Hawk," she said.  "They asked me
to come up, and now they won't let me go.  They
tried to shut down the lid when they heard you
coming, but I wouldn't let them."
</p>

<p>
"I am much obliged to you," said the hawk,
eyeing the trembling young rooks with a pleasant
smile.  "I was feeling a bit peckish.  Can I do
anything for you in return?"
</p>

<p>
"If you could take me down to the garden,"
said Elsie timidly, "I should be so grateful."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," cried the hawk.  "That's nothing."
</p>

<p>
He fluttered across, and took hold of her sash
with his claws.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be back in a moment," he said to the
young rooks, with a kind of hungry laugh.
</p>

<p>
Elsie shut her eyes.  She felt herself skimming
through the air at a terrific pace&mdash;there was a
sudden bang&mdash;and she woke up with a start to find
herself sitting in the garden chair.
</p>

<p>
Her brother was standing in the middle of the
lawn.  His gun was at his shoulder, and he was
just going to take a second shot at a large hawk,
which he had missed with his first barrel.
</p>

<p>
Elsie jumped up with a wild scream.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, Jack!" she cried.  "Stop!"
</p>

<p>
He was so surprised that he lowered his gun,
and in another moment the hawk was out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Elsie," he said.  "What's the matter?
Did I frighten you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jack!" she cried.  "You were just going
to shoot the hawk!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know I was," he said, laughing.  "It's
after the young rooks.  It had one in its claws just
now."
</p>

<p>
"Jack!" said Elsie very solemnly.  "That
wasn't a young rook, that was me."
</p>

<p>
"What on earth do you mean, Elsie?" cried her
brother.  "You've been dreaming."
</p>

<p>
Elsie shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't, Jack," she said, and then she
sat down in the chair and told him the whole story.
</p>

<p>
He listened with a grave face right to the very
end, and then bent over and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad I didn't shoot the hawk," he said.
"Still, you know, Elsie dear, it was only a dream."
</p>

<p>
But Elsie knew better.

<h3>
The Bronze-Haired Girl
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"If you will pass me my guitar," said George, "I
will sing to you."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather you washed up," I replied.
"It would be more of a novelty."
</p>

<p>
"For one who professes to be an artist,"
returned George, with unruffled serenity, "you are
painfully lacking in sensibility.  A man who can
speak of washing up ten minutes after tea on a
golden June evening&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you are going to get poetical, George," I
said, "I would sooner you sang.  Here you are."
</p>

<p>
I reached out an arm into the tent, and tossed
him across the somewhat battered banjo which was
lying on his bed.  He caught it neatly with his
left hand.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you would play cricket with a
Stradivarius," he said reproachfully.  "What shall I
sing?"
</p>

<p>
"Anything short."
</p>

<p>
"I shall sing something sad," he went on,
disregarding my interruption.  "I always feel very
wistful after tea.  Besides, I am in love with the
bronze-haired girl at Otter's Holt, and perhaps
she will hear me and think that I am unhappy."
</p>

<p>
"She is much more likely to think that I am,"
said I.  "Fire ahead."
</p>

<p>
He twanged two or three experimental chords,
tightened a couple of pegs, and then settling down
again in his basket-chair, launched out pathetically
into the time-honoured ballad of "London
Bridge":
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hurry along, sorrow and song,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is vanity 'neath the sun;<br />
  Velvet and rags, so the world wags,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the river no more shall run.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I shall not applaud you," I said, when he had
finished.  "You might mistake courtesy for an
encore."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if the bronze-haired girl heard me?"
murmured George, laying down the banjo.
</p>

<p>
"Unless she is deaf," I pointed out, "she could
scarcely have avoided it.  She probably thinks we
are a couple of music-hall comedians."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I had better call to-morrow and
apologize," said George thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
I looked him in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"George," I observed, "if I find you thrusting
your society on that defenceless young
woman, I shall communicate with the local
policeman."
</p>

<p>
"She is not defenceless," objected George.
"She has a dog and an old woman with her; and
as for youth&mdash;well, I am but a lad myself."
</p>

<p>
I laughed unkindly.
</p>

<p>
"In the matter of hair," I said, glancing at the
top of George's head.
</p>

<p>
"Hair," said George hastily, "has nothing to do
with it.  Hair is an excrescence, a hideous and
perpetual reminder of our arboreal ancestry."
</p>

<p>
"You had better tell her that," I replied.  "She
would appreciate it."
</p>

<p>
"I was not speaking of bronze hair.  You never
saw a bronze-haired monkey."
</p>

<p>
"It may be dyed," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
George picked up his banjo.
</p>

<p>
"Such blasphemy," he said, "deserves a
heavy punishment.  I shall sing you 'Beauty's
Eyes.'"
</p>

<p>
"Is there no option?" I pleaded.
</p>

<p>
With his thumb on the strings, George paused.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "you can wash up."
</p>

<p>
I did.
</p>

<p>
Next morning at breakfast George announced
his intention of walking over to Chertsey.
</p>

<p>
"They are taking entries for the regatta," he
explained.  "And I want to put our names down
for the double punting."
</p>

<p>
"How about getting a couple of insurance
policies at the same time?" I suggested.  (I have
punted with George before.)
</p>

<p>
"What's your programme?" he inquired,
disregarding my excellent proposal.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go up the Bourne," I said.  "I want to
finish my picture, and the light is just right this
morning."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't collar the sardines," he replied
selfishly.  "I should like 'em for supper."
</p>

<p>
He sauntered off about half-past ten, stopping
in the garden to pick our only carnation for his
buttonhole.
</p>

<p>
After some research, I unearthed a tinned
tongue, some bread and butter, a cake, and last,
but not least, a bottle of claret.  These I
transplanted tenderly to the punt, and then, putting
in my painting materials, pushed off in leisurely
fashion up the backwater.
</p>

<p>
As I passed Otter's Holt, the long, low,
creeper-covered bungalow that adjoined our own
camping-ground, I caught a glimpse of the girl who had
inflamed George's susceptible heart.  She was
lying in a deck-chair in the verandah, reading a
book.  By her side crouched a large brindled
bulldog, who looked up and emitted a sharp "woof!"
as the splash of my punt-pole reached his ears.
</p>

<p>
His mistress put out a small reproving hand.
"Lie down, sir!" she said, in a voice that no decent
bulldog could possibly have resisted.
</p>

<p>
"There are excuses for George," I said to myself
as an intervening dump of willow shut out any
further observations.
</p>

<p>
The Bourne, as is usual on weekdays, was
delightfully deserted.  I pushed my way slowly up
its narrow course, thrusting aside the overhanging
bushes, and startling an occasional kingfisher into
a streak of living blue.
</p>

<p>
My destination was just round the fourth bend,
a place where the sunshine played a bewitching
game of hide-and-seek through the branches of an
elm.  It was this tracery of light and shadow that
I was attempting to transfer to my canvas.
</p>

<p>
Tying the punt up to the bank, I pulled out my
paints and set to work.  It was one of those
mornings which make one doubt whether any
conceivable heaven could really be as attractive as
earth.  An infinitely faint breeze just stirred the
leaves overhead, and only the occasional splash of
a fish or the shrill twitter of a bird disturbed the
fragrant silence around.
</p>

<p>
For about an hour I laboured at my picture with
commendable industry.  But somehow or other I
did not make as rapid progress as such diligence
deserved.  A vision of a girl with bronze hair kept
flitting before my eyes in the most elusive and
disconcerting fashion.  Once I actually found
myself murmuring, "Lie down, sir!" apparently
in an attempt to analyze the peculiar charm with
which these three words seemed to be associated.
</p>

<p>
For a person of well-regulated mind this was
distinctly humiliating.  I began to take myself
to task.  "Because a young woman happens to
address a bulldog in your hearing," I inquired,
"is that any reason why you should waste an
entire morning?"
</p>

<p>
Getting no reply, I continued with increasing
sternness: "You are as bad as George.  You are
making an idiot of yourself over a red-haired slip of
a girl whom you have only seen about three times
in your life.  Why, if it comes to that, you don't
even know her name!  Sir, I am disgusted with you."
</p>

<p>
Relieved by this Johnsonian rebuke, I again
turned to my picture, and for twenty minutes or so
worked on with unruffled concentration.  Then it
suddenly occurred to me that I was hungry.
</p>

<p>
I moved aside my paints, carefully laid down the
canvas in the end of the punt, and, pulling out the
luncheon-basket from under the seat, began to
prepare my frugal but well-earned meal.  The
tongue, my <i>chef-d'œuvre</i>, was encased in one of
those ingenious tins which you open by twisting a
key.  I was deep in this fascinating process when
my ears were assailed by the sudden splash of an
approaching craft.
</p>

<p>
I looked up with a frown.  Such an intrusion on
my privacy seemed to me to savour of gross
impertinence.  I had come to regard the Bourne
as my private property, which I was magnanimous
enough to open to the public cm Saturdays and
Sundays.  And here was some coarse-grained
stranger thrusting his way in at one o'clock on
Tuesday afternoon.
</p>

<p>
"In future," I said to myself, "I shall mine the
channel."
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer came that offensive splash,
varied by the occasional swish of a parted bush,
and the creaking of an indifferently handled
punt-pole.  Assuming an expression of cold displeasure,
I sat up and waited on Fate.  At last the nose of a
punt thrust itself round the bend, and a moment
later the intruder emerged into full view.
</p>

<p>
In my agitation I dropped the tongue in the
butter.  It was the bronze-haired girl from Otter's
Holt!
</p>

<p>
Then a series of incidents occurred with the
bewildering rapidity of a cinematograph.
Disturbed, apparently, by my unfortunate <i>lapsus
linguÃ¦</i>, the bulldog, which was crouching in the
stern of the punt, leaped forward, barking his
defiance.  In his ardour he cannoned heavily
against a basket reposing on the seat.  There was
a splash, a cry of despair from the bronze-haired
maiden, and the aforesaid basket settled down
peacefully at the bottom of the Bourne.
</p>

<p>
Let it be stated to my credit that I rose to the
situation with some promptness.  Unhitching the
painter by a dexterous twitch, I snatched up my
pole, and, with a couple of sharp shoves, sped
gracefully to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry," I said.  "I am afraid I frightened
your dog.  May I make amends by getting
out the basket?"
</p>

<p>
"It's very kind of you," she said simply.  "Of
course, it wasn't your fault at all.  Come here
sir!"  This last to the dog.
</p>

<p>
I turned my sleeves up to the shoulders, and,
leaning over the side of the punt, groped down
through the shallow water until I got hold of the
handle.  Then, dripping but triumphant, I
extracted my burden.
</p>

<p>
"I hope there is nothing to spoil in it," I said.
</p>

<p>
She smiled and shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It's only a matter of a few sandwiches.  I am
very much obliged to you, and extremely sorry to
have been the cause of so much trouble."
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary," I replied, "it is I and the dog
who ought to apologize to you."
</p>

<p>
"I can't imagine why he was so silly," she said,
administering a reproving pat to the animal, who
still eyed me with some disfavour.  "As a rule, he
is as good as gold in a boat."
</p>

<p>
"What do you call him?" I inquired, in a shameless
attempt to prolong the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Winston Churchill," she said, with another
smile.  "He was christened before I got him."
</p>

<p>
"His jaw is certainly well developed," I observed.
</p>

<p>
She laughed, and a short pause followed.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, "I must be getting back."
</p>

<p>
"But really," I protested, "you have only just
arrived."  Then a sudden fit of recklessness seized
me.  "Don't go because your lunch is spoiled," I
pleaded.  "I have a whole tongue, to say nothing
of some excellent bread, and some good, if rather
dilapidated, butter.  As the destroyer of your
sandwiches I can surely without impertinence
offer you a fair compensation."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, still smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't think you are impertinent," she
said, "but I believe that no really nice girl ever
accepts an invitation from a perfect stranger.  It
would distress me to think that I was outside the
pale."
</p>

<p>
Her brown eyes twinkled so deliriously that I
cast subterfuge to the winds.
</p>

<p>
"Do stay," I begged.  "I have been alone all
the morning wrestling with an obstinate picture,
and I am desperately in need of a little cheering
society.  Besides, there is nothing so very
unconventional in the idea.  Winston Churchill will
make a most efficient chaperon."
</p>

<p>
She wavered.
</p>

<p>
"And you can cut me afterwards," I added.
</p>

<p>
The corners of her mouth twitched.
</p>

<p>
"Your arguments," she said, "are most persuasive."
</p>

<p>
We pulled the two punts alongside each other
and fastened them to the bank.  By this time
Winston Churchill seemed to have accepted me as
a harmless and necessary evil.  He sat up in the
stern and watched me with intelligent interest,
while I completed my preparations for lunch.
</p>

<p>
"You are in his good books now," said the
bronze-haired girl, stroking him gently down the
back with her fingers.  "He thinks that people
who provide food cannot be altogether bad."
</p>

<p>
I handed her the plate.
</p>

<p>
"To give tongue," I said, "is the recognized
method of expressing friendship in canine circles."
</p>

<p>
"And, I suppose, giving the only plate implies
the same idea amongst human beings?"
</p>

<p>
"George and I generally eat off paper," I
replied.  "We prefer it.  We are leading the simple
life."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said; "I heard you yesterday.  If I
remember rightly, you had arrived at the
conclusion that all was vanity."
</p>

<p>
I held out a cunningly carved slice of bread-and-butter.
</p>

<p>
"George," I said, "was responsible for the song,
and Solomon for the sentiments.  I am innocent."
</p>

<p>
She accepted both the bread-and-butter and the
apology.
</p>

<p>
"You are an artist," she said, "to say nothing of
being a knight-errant.  One cannot have all the
talents."
</p>

<p>
"When I was a small boy," I remarked, "I
remember I had a nurse who used to check my
incipient tendency to sarcasm by saying warningly:
'Hush, Master Jack!  No one will love you
if you talk like that.'"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" she cried, with a protesting little
laugh.  "I really meant it for a compliment.  I
paint very badly myself, but I know good work
when I see it.  Yours is delightful."
</p>

<p>
"I only hope the excellent Mr. Rosenthal will
share your opinion," I said.
</p>

<p>
She puckered her forehead in a charming
expression of mock bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"And who is Mr. Rosenthal?  He sounds very rich."
</p>

<p>
"He is a patron of the arts," I explained.  "His
father provided the British army with shoe-leather
for some years, and the son dispenses the proceeds
from a castle at Cookham.  This trifle has been
commissioned for the banquet-hall."
</p>

<p>
"You must feel very proud," she observed
gravely.  "May I look at it more closely?"
</p>

<p>
I handed her the canvas, and, propping it up
in her punt, she proceeded to criticize it with an
intelligence and knowledge that considerably
surprised me.
</p>

<p>
"I have my doubts as to your painting so
badly," I said, with some suspicion.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"My father is an artist," she answered.  "I
have inherited his taste without his abilities."
</p>

<p>
"Has he a taste for cheap claret?" I inquired,
holding up the bottle.
</p>

<p>
"For about half a glass, I think."
</p>

<p>
I poured it out, and filled my own.
</p>

<p>
"To Mr. Rosenthal," she said gaily.
</p>

<p>
"For my own part," I said, "I shall drink to
Winston Churchill.  I find his habit of upsetting
baskets a most commendable one."
</p>

<p>
We passed on unhurriedly to the cheese and cake
courses.  As our acquaintance mellowed, the
almost nervous flippancy with which we had
bridged over its earlier stages gradually died away.
Quite unaffected, and gifted with a most refreshing
sense of humour, the bronze-haired girl proved a
delightful companion.  She had evidently been
brought up in an unusual sort of atmosphere, for
she chatted away easily about art and books and
people, without a trace of that embarrassing
shyness of opinion which seems to be the hallmark of
a conventionally educated girl.
</p>

<p>
On the ground that she was chiefly responsible
for their present condition, she insisted on helping
me wash up our scanty luncheon outfit.
</p>

<p>
"A plate is such a nice, clean thing by nature,"
she said, swishing it about in the water, "that I
always think one ought to attend to it immediately
after lunch.  It must suffer horribly if you leave it
lying about all covered with grease or jam.  I think
I shall start a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Plates."
</p>

<p>
When we had packed away everything into the
basket, she accepted one of those excellent Russian
cigarettes which my friend M. Demidoff makes for
me, and, arranging our cushions, we lay back luxuriously
in our respective punts and talked aimlessly,
volubly, and cheerfully about everything on God's
earth.  From where I was lying I could just see the
tip of her nose, and I directed my conversation to
that.
</p>

<p>
By three o'clock I had decided firmly that
arrangements must be made which would involve
the possibility of our meeting freely in the future;
and when at four she sat up suddenly and said she
must go home, I had arrived at a state in which I
was quite unable to contemplate existence without her.
</p>

<p>
"We shall expect you to tea to-morrow, then,"
she said, "provided it is not too violent a break in
the simple life.  Of course, if Mr. George likes to
bring his banjo&mdash;"  Her eyes twinkled mischievously.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no," I interrupted; "don't let us be morbid
on a day like this."
</p>

<p>
She gave me her dear, cool, slender hand for a
moment, and then, with the blessed Winston
Churchill sitting up amiably in the stern of the
punt, she pushed off down the stream.
</p>

<p>
It was not until she had vanished round the bend
that I remembered I had never asked her name.
</p>

<p>
George was still away when I got back.  As it
was after five, however, I decided not to wait for
him.  I put the kettle on the "Primus," and
walked about the bungalow, singing "Who is
Sylvia?" and other similar ballads until it boiled
over.  Then I made tea, and sat down in a delightfully
contented frame of mind.  I was so happy
that I ate all the sardines before I noticed what I
was doing.
</p>

<p>
George came in a moment afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" he said.  "Still at breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
"I breakfasted, George," I answered, "exactly
two centuries ago."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that must account for the horrible energy
with which you're eating now."  He looked round
the table.  "Here, hang it," he added, in a sudden
tone of horror, "you've finished the sardines!"
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, George," I said penitently.  "I
have been in a very exalted, spiritual meditation,
and I did not notice what I was eating."
</p>

<p>
He sat down with a disbelieving grunt.
</p>

<p>
"Well, next time an attack comes on, get out
some of those mouldy biscuits.  This is a nice
way to treat one who has been slaving for your
benefit.  I was looking forward to those sardines
all the way home."
</p>

<p>
"What have you been doing?" I inquired, in a
timely effort to turn the conversation into a less
poignant channel.
</p>

<p>
George opened a bottle of Bass, and helped
himself to an impressive slice of cake.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "I shoved our names down for
the double punting all right.  As far as I can see,
we've got a jolly good chance, if you'll only take it
seriously."
</p>

<p>
"I take it very seriously," I interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Barton was there," went on George; "he is
entering with his brother.  It would be rather
fun if we were to run up against them in the
finals."
</p>

<p>
"We are certain to do that," I observed, "if we
get so far."
</p>

<p>
"I went back to Barton's place to lunch," said
George.  "And, oh, by the way, I found out all
about the bronze-haired girl at Otter's Holt.
Barton knows her well."
</p>

<p>
I struck a match to light my cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" I remarked carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she's married."
</p>

<p>
I suppose I must have opened my mouth, for the
cigarette dropped on the table.
</p>

<p>
"She's what?" I exclaimed, after a moment's
pause.
</p>

<p>
"Married," said George, with a laugh.  "Her
husband's in the wool market.  His name's
Congreve; Barton says he's a very decent fellow.
They've taken Otter's Holt for the summer."
</p>

<p>
If you can imagine the end of the world coming
just as you had inherited a large fortune, you will
get a very fair idea of my emotions at that
moment.  I stared at George in a kind of ghastly
amazement; then, with an effort, I moistened my
lips.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe it," I said.
</p>

<p>
"It's true, though," said George.  "Barton is
coming over to stay with them next month.  Just
my atrocious luck!  I always fall in love with
women who either hate me or have already got
husbands."
</p>

<p>
I suppose something in my face must have
attracted his attention, for he stopped and looked
at me curiously.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, old man?" he asked.
"Feeling bad?"
</p>

<p>
With a big effort I pulled myself together, and
picked up the cigarette which I had dropped.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much, George," I said.  "I've got a
bit of a headache.  Too many sardines, I expect."
</p>

<p>
"You have been sitting about in the sun without
a hat again," said George severely.  "I told
you what would happen.  Now, if you had a little
less hair, like me, you might have a little more
sense."  He got up and put his hand on my
shoulder.  "You tumble in and lie down," he
added.  "I'll wash up."
</p>

<p>
And George did.
</p>

<p>
I spent what I believe is generally called "a
wretched night."  It must have been about two in
the morning when I finally consigned Barton and
the bronze-haired girl, and my own ridiculous
emotions, to the bottom of the Thames, and,
turning savagely over on my side, dropped into a
troubled, useless sort of sleep.
</p>

<p>
I was awake again at six, roused by the vigorous
carolling of a thrush, whose own love affairs were
apparently in excellent order.  George was still
sleeping.  I crawled out carefully so as not to
disturb him, and, taking a towel, made my way
down to the river.
</p>

<p>
There was the promise of another lovely day in
the air, and the warm early-morning sunshine
seemed to bathe one in a kind of comforting caress.
By the time I had had my usual swim and dried
myself on the bank, my turbulent feelings of the
previous night had given place to what I believed
to be a more or less philosophic resignation.
</p>

<p>
After all, I said to myself, there was nothing to
be gained by weeping and gnashing one's teeth.  It
was distinctly distressing that my only attempt at
falling in love should have met with so disastrous
a check; still, other people had had equally
unpleasant experiences, and had managed to survive
them.  Was it not brave old George Wither who
had summed up the situation in that delightfully
reasonable couplet:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For if she be not for me,<br />
  What care I for whom she be?<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I repeated the words aloud several times as I
strolled back.  It comforted me to persuade
myself that I agreed with them.
</p>

<p>
I found George outside the tent, shaving.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" he said.  "Feeling fitter?"
</p>

<p>
"I am quite well this morning, thank you,
George," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"In that case," said he kindly, "you may cook
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
I unearthed some bacon, and, while engaged in
chasing two rather elusive slices round the frying-pan,
I debated with myself as to whether I should
mention the invitation to tea.  I had no intention
of going myself&mdash;that would be altogether too
great a strain upon my philosophy&mdash;but as my
adventure of the previous day was bound to come
out sooner or later, it seemed rather unfair to rob
George of an afternoon's entertainment.  Still, in
my present state of mind, I shied violently at the
thought of the explanations which would be
involved by my telling him.  I felt that anything
in the nature of chaff, even from George, would be
quite unbearable.  So, like Mrs. Grimmage, "I
just went on cookin', and said nuffin'."
</p>

<p>
It was the boy from Dunton's Boathouse who
eventually supplied the solution to the problem,
in the shape of the morning post.  There was a
letter for George, and as soon as he opened it he
gave an exclamation of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"My futile partner," said George, "is sick of a
cold, and desires me to come up to town for the
day.  Fancy catching cold this weather!"
</p>

<p>
"It suggests considerable skill," I admitted.
"Are you going?"
</p>

<p>
"Must," answered George sadly.  "He says
that a man is coming to see us about designing
some pigsties.  In the present state of architecture
we cannot afford to miss such an opportunity."
</p>

<p>
"From your ideas of keeping the tent tidy," I
observed, "you ought to be an authority on the
subject."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be down by the six-thirty," said George.
"What will you do with yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall spend the day," I replied, "in trying to
forget certain incidents which ought never to have
happened."
</p>

<p>
"If you forget them all," said George cynically,
"you will have a busy time."
</p>

<p>
My self-imposed programme, though excellent
in theory, did not prove very successful in practice.
George went off, grumbling, at about half-past
eight, and, having washed up the breakfast-things,
and tidied up the tent, I made an attempt to settle
down to some black-and-white work, which an
impatient editor had just reminded me was several
days overdue.
</p>

<p>
At the end of an hour all I had completed was a
very passable likeness of Mrs. Congreve punting.
I sat and stared at it in a kind of stupid trance.  It
seemed impossible to believe that my beautiful
romance of yesterday was dead and buried in some
obscure vestry.  My whole nature rose up in
passionate revolt against such an incredible idea.
All the pseudo-resignation on which I had prided
myself in the early morning deserted me in the
hour of need.  I began to recall the way she spoke,
the charming manner in which the corners of her
mouth turned up before she laughed, and the
gracious atmosphere of tenderness and humour in
which she seemed to live.
</p>

<p>
At last, with a groan, I threw down the pencil,
and got up from my chair.
</p>

<p>
"Hang it," I said, "I can't stand this any longer!"
</p>

<p>
I walked to the door of the tent, and looked out.
Except for a couple of barges, emerging from the
lock, the river was deserted.  On the further bank,
however, alongside of Dunton's Boathouse, a
motor-car was just discharging a giggling cargo of
flimsily dressed damsels and beflannelled youths.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at them inhospitably, and then a
sudden idea struck me.  Why not walk over to
Brooklands and watch the motor-racing?  A
savage four-mile-an-hour tramp across country
was exactly the medicine I needed; and then there
was always the chance of seeing somebody killed.
I felt that a real, good sanguinary smash-up would
appeal to me immensely in my present state of
mind.
</p>

<p>
Without wasting any further time I picked up
my hat and stick, and then, after looking in at
Williamson's bungalow, and asking him to keep
an eye on our tent, I set off across the fields in the
direction of Weybridge.
</p>

<p>
It was not until I had reached and was walking
up the main street that I remembered I had sent
no message to Otter's Holt.  After all, I had
accepted the invitation to tea, and some sort of an
excuse, however futile, was obviously needed.  I
turned in at the post office, and, after a moment's
hesitation, wrote out the following telegram:
</p>

<p>
"Am very sorry we shall not be able to come
to tea this afternoon.  Called away on urgent
business."
</p>

<p>
Then, having put my name to this lie, I addressed
it to Mrs. Congreve, Otter's Holt, Shepperton,
and handed it in.
</p>

<p>
If Brooklands failed to provide me with a
catastrophe, it at least helped me to take my mind
off my own affairs.  Amongst the competitors
was a man called Carfax, whom I knew fairly well
as a fellow-member of the Barbarians.  He was
driving a monstrous 90 h.p. abortion; and, after
the racing was over, he took me for a spin round
the track, at the bracing speed of about eighty
miles an hour.  Subsequently we dropped in for
tea with some friend of his, who had built himself
a turreted atrocity in red brick, looking out over
Brooklands grounds.  Here I met three or four
other motor enthusiasts, and listened in dazed
humility while they discussed with some warmth
the relative merits of various magnetos and
carburettors.
</p>

<p>
It must have been well after six when I started
to walk back to Shepperton.  The evening was
delightfully warm and still, and, soothed by a mild
Cabana, which my host had insisted on my accepting
before I left, I strolled leisurely on, wrapped
once more in a kind of melancholy submission to
destiny.  I was even able to let my thoughts
wander over the events of the previous afternoon
without awakening any other emotion but a
vague, luxurious sadness.  For the moment I
seemed to have escaped from my own personality,
and to be looking down like one of the gods with
infinite pity upon the tragedy of human desire.
</p>

<p>
Turning off half-way along the canal, I struck
into a short cut which led across the fields to the
spot where our tent was pitched.  About half a
mile from the river this path ran through the yard
of the farm from which we purchased our eggs and
milk.  At this point it was really a private
thoroughfare, but the farmer, in view of George's
profitable appetite, made no objection to our  using
it as often as we pleased.
</p>

<p>
I was just opening the gate which led into the
yard, when a sharp "woof" brought me to an
abrupt halt.  The wild suspicion that held me
momentarily paralyzed was confirmed a moment
later.  There was a pattering of feet, and Winston
Churchill sidled out from the porch of the house.
The moment he saw who it was, he sat down in the
mud, and threw up his accursed head in a howl of
welcome.  With a supreme effort I turned to flee,
but it was too late.  The door of the farm opened,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
God in heaven!  How good it was to see her again!
</p>

<p>
She was carrying a jug of milk in her dear hands,
and she stood still and looked at me with a grave
smile.
</p>

<p>
I took off my hat.
</p>

<p>
"I hope," she said, "that the urgent business
has come to a successful conclusion."
</p>

<p>
I felt quite incapable of saying anything except
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad of that," she went on, "because you
missed a very good tea."
</p>

<p>
Then a sudden insanity gripped me by the
throat, and I committed that most unpardonable
of all blunders&mdash;I told the truth.
</p>

<p>
"There was no urgent business!" I blurted out.
"The telegram was a lie!"
</p>

<p>
She wrinkled up her forehead again, in that
altogether adorable way of her own.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?" she said.  "And why should you
send me a lie?"
</p>

<p>
I dropped the cigar which I was holding, and
ground it into the mud with my boot.
</p>

<p>
"I heard you were married," I said hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence, and then, as I
live, she began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said, "that accounts for the telegram!
But it seems a poor reason for wasting a cigar."
</p>

<p>
I stared at her dully.  "I suppose I must
appear a particularly ludicrous sort of idiot," I
said.  "My only excuse is that I can't help it.
Good-bye!"
</p>

<p>
She put out one hand, as though to stop me.
</p>

<p>
"Before you go," she said gently, "you might
tell me when I was married.  After all, it's only
natural that I should be a little interested in the
matter."
</p>

<p>
I clutched hold of the gate.  Everything except
her face had suddenly become dim and distant.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean&mdash;do you mean to say that it's a
mistake?" I gasped.
</p>

<p>
"There are some people," she answered
mischievously, "who say that marriage is always a
mistake."
</p>

<p>
"But George&mdash;Barton&mdash;Congreve," I stammered.
</p>

<p>
"You have not got his Christian names quite
right," she interrupted.  "They are Walter
Vernon.  I know, you see, because he happens to be
my brother-in-law."
</p>

<p>
"Then you're not married?" I shouted wildly.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said.  "But isn't it a little unnecessary
to inform the entire neighbourhood of the
fact?"
</p>

<p>
I laid my head down on the gate, and relieved
my feelings in an insane outburst of laughter.
When I felt better, I straightened myself and
wiped my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"George is responsible," I said.  "He came
home yesterday and told me that you were."
</p>

<p>
"Untruthfulness," she answered, smiling, "seems
to play an important part in the simple life."
</p>

<p>
"He had described you to a man called Barton,"
I explained, "and the scoundrel had pronounced
you to be Mrs. Congreve."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," she said, "my sister also has red hair.
She and Walter came down this afternoon.  But
for the urgent business, you would have met them
at tea."
</p>

<p>
I looked at her for a moment, and then suddenly
all the ridiculous little trimmings of life whisked
away into the infinite.  I opened the gate, and
took the milk-jug out of her hands.
</p>

<p>
"I love you!" I said simply.
</p>

<p>
"That is very nice of you," she answered; "but
do be careful with the milk."
</p>

<p>
"I love you," I repeated, with firmness, "and
I want you to marry me."
</p>

<p>
The corners of her mouth twitched divinely.
</p>

<p>
"This," she said, "is no place for a proposal.
If you really want to marry me, you must come up
to Otter's Holt, and woo me properly."
</p>

<p>
But her eyes had given me my answer.

<h3>
His Reverence
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A little company of men, three convicts and
two warders, swung out under the great granite
arch that leads into Dartmoor Prison.  Turning
to the left, they strode past the Governor's garden
with its gay beds of tulips and hyacinths, and
still keeping up a brisk pace, emerged a few minutes
later into the main street of Princetown.  Here
they came to a halt in front of a depressing-looking
stone building which bore an inscription announcing
it to be the "Recreation Rooms."
</p>

<p>
Two villagers were standing chatting on the
further side of the road, but beyond the briefest of
brief glances they betrayed no interest in the
arrival of the party.  For the inhabitants of
Princetown the spectacle of convicts and warders has
lost that attraction which it still possesses for the
citizens of less happily situated towns.  It is only
the visitors to the hotel who stare, and on the
present occasion there were no visitors about.
They were all out on the moor, getting the best of a
fine spring morning, and as many trout as it might
please Fate to deceive.
</p>

<p>
One of the warders unlocked the door, and the
small party mounted the steps and entered the
building.  The interior certainly showed some
traces of the recreation referred to outside.  At
the further end of the room was a stage set for an
out-of-door scene, while a number of chairs piled
up in the body of the hall suggested that an
entertainment of some kind was under early
contemplation.
</p>

<p>
"All them chairs have got to be set out in rows,"
remarked the warder who had opened the door.
"Don't take the front lot too near the stage, and
leave a space up the middle, so as folks can pass in
and out.  Bascombe, you come along with me!"
</p>

<p>
The convict addressed, a burly man of about
sixty, with twinkling black eyes, followed the
warder up a small flight of steps at the side of the
stage into a room beyond.
</p>

<p>
It was a nondescript sort of apartment, serving
apparently the triple purpose of a green-room, a
dressing-room, and a scene-painter's studio.  A
large theatrical basket with Clarkson's label on it
stood in the centre of the floor, and propped
against the walls were several pieces of blank stage
canvas awaiting the artist's hand.
</p>

<p>
"That's them, Bascombe," said the warder,
jerking his thumb at the latter articles.  "We
want you to paint a room on 'em.  It's supposed
to be a scholar's room at Oxford College.  D'ye
think you can do it?"
</p>

<p>
The convict nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"It's for 'Dick's Uncle,' ain't it, sir?" he drawled.
"I remember the set.  Saw it from the gallery at
the old Strand."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said the warder.  "Well, you
shove along with it.  There are your paints and
brushes."
</p>

<p>
He pointed to a small wooden table where a supply
of scene-painter's accessories were neatly laid
out.
</p>

<p>
The convict wandered slowly round the room,
inspecting the various pieces of canvas with a
critical eye.  Then, selecting the largest, he pulled
up the table alongside, and taking the palette in his
hand began to prepare his colours.
</p>

<p>
It was soon evident that he was no novice at his
business.  The few bold strokes in charcoal with
which he outlined his sketch had all that firmness
and accuracy that only come from long practice.
</p>

<p>
With fascinated eyes the warder gazed upon the
process.  The gradual emergence of an interior at
Oxford College, in reply to the apparently
irresponsible dabs and daubs of a convict, seemed to
him to savour of the miraculous.  Only the iron
sense of discipline which permeated their relations
prevented him from openly expressing his admiration
to the artist.
</p>

<p>
After watching the work for about a quarter of
an hour, he at length rose reluctantly to his feet,
picking up the rifle which he had balanced against
a chair.
</p>

<p>
"I'm goin' on the stage to see about the gas
brackets, Bascombe," he said.  "I'll be back in a
minute.  You push on with that there paintin'.
We want it ready for the re'earsal Friday, if you
can manage it."
</p>

<p>
He crossed the room to a door, which apparently
opened into the street, and, turning the handle,
satisfied himself that it was properly locked.
Then, after a final look round and a last approving
glance at the canvas, he clumped off through the
narrow exit that led to the stage.
</p>

<p>
For a minute or so after his departure the convict
continued to paint.  He was sketching in the
rough outline of a fire-place, and the operation
evidently engrossed his entire attention.  As he
worked he whistled softly and tunefully, stepping
back every now and then to contemplate his
labours.  At last he laid down his brush, and,
stretching himself with a prolonged yawn, gazed
listlessly about him.  His eye fell on the big basket
in the centre of the room.  He stared at it for a
moment in a sort of idle curiosity, then with a swift
glance at the door through which the warder had
gone out he stepped noiselessly across and lifted
the lid.
</p>

<p>
Inside were several suits of clothes neatly folded
and tied into separate bundles.  There were also
two or three cardboard boxes, each one labelled
with a different name.  For a moment the convict
contemplated them thoughtfully; then with a
sudden grin he bent down and lifted up one of the
boxes.  A second glance at the door assured him
that he was still unobserved.  Opening his find
he took out its contents&mdash;a carefully dressed wig of
silver-grey hair.  A moment later he was standing
in front of a small looking-glass upon the wall,
complacently regarding its effect upon his own
cropped head.
</p>

<p>
The transformation was certainly a successful
one.  Coming right down on his forehead, without
a scalp-piece to destroy the illusion, the wig altered
his appearance to an extraordinary extent.  But
for the hideous broad-arrowed jacket below he
might easily have passed for a rugged,
good-natured-looking barrister or country parson.
</p>

<p>
Something of this incongruity of costume
seemed to strike Mr. Bascombe.  With a broadening
grin, he retraced his steps to the basket and
silently continued his researches.
</p>

<p>
The first bundle of clothes which he examined
consisted of an old-fashioned suit of large checks,
evidently intended for a comic gentleman of
mature years.  Placing them on one side, he next
pulled out a blue and buff livery, gaily ornamented
with brass buttons.  It was a handsome costume,
but with the sensibility of a true artist Mr. Bascombe
realized at once that it was unsuited to the
remainder of his appearance.  Laying it carefully
on top of the other, he again rummaged in the
basket, his efforts on this occasion being rewarded
by a roll of sombre garments tied round with a
piece of red tape.  He slipped off the latter, and,
depositing a pair of trousers and waistcoat on the
ground, held up a long black coat of clerical cut.
</p>

<p>
Now, Mr. Bascombe was the possessor of a
richly-developed sense of humour, which for five
years had been suffering from a deplorable lack of
exercise.  Even with the certainty of punishment
ahead, he was quite unable to resist the temptation
offered by this outfit.  The sight of the warder's
face when that gentleman returned would, he felt,
be more than sufficient compensation for the
reduced diet and loss of marks that would
inevitably follow.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes' swift and silent work, and the
metamorphosis was complete.  He stood before
the glass smiling hugely at his reflection&mdash;a perfect
specimen of a weather-beaten parson of the Jack
Russell school.
</p>

<p>
Up till then no idea but that of startling the
warder had entered his head.  He had drifted into
the jest quite undeliberately, dressing himself up
solely out of a sense of mischievous amusement.
It was the unexpected perfection of his disguise
that suddenly suggested to him the possibilities of
the situation.
</p>

<p>
He turned a rapid glance on the locked door,
and another on the pile of convict clothes that lay
huddled together beside the basket.  For an
instant he stood undecided, then stealthily as a
cat he again stepped across the room and picked up
his discarded garments.  Tying them round with
the piece of red tape, he thrust them down into the
bottom of the basket, covering them over with
the two suits and the box that he had previously
taken out.  This done, he shut the lid, and once
more stood motionless, listening intently to the
sounds that reached him from the hall.  He could
hear nothing but the dull tramp of his fellow-convicts'
feet passing up and down, and the clatter
of the chairs as they were set in their places.
</p>

<p>
With the grin still embedded on his countenance
he slipped noiselessly across to the outer door.
Bending down, he examined the lock.  It was a
simple affair&mdash;almost insultingly simple for a
gentleman of Mr. Bascombe's capabilities.
</p>

<p>
He straightened himself and cast a quick look
round the room.  On the wall hung a large
coloured portrait of King Edward VII, poorly
disguised as a British Admiral.  Mr. Bascombe lifted
it down with a delicate care that may have been
due to loyalty, and swiftly unfastened the thick
wire by which it had been suspended.  From this
he twisted off a piece about ten inches in length,
and, picking up the palette knife from the table,
resumed his crouching position in front of the
door.
</p>

<p>
For about a minute and a half he remained in
this attitude, a faint scratching noise and his own
heavy breathing being the only audible indications
of his labour.  Then suddenly came a grating
sound, followed a moment later by a sharp click.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe did not wait to see if he had been
overheard.  Rising quickly and silently to his feet,
he opened the door just wide enough to enable him
to reconnoitre his position.  Except for a black
cat luxuriously scratching herself in the sunshine,
the roadway opposite was empty.  A swift glance
up and down showed him there was no one nearer
than the post office.  Without a trace of hurry or
nervousness he stepped out and closed the door
behind him.  A moment later with magnificent
unconcern he was sauntering slowly down the
street.
</p>

<p>
The few people that he passed paid no particular
attention to him.  A sunburned, holiday-making
clergyman, with smiling countenance and leisurely
gait, is almost as common a sight in Princetown as
a convict.  Stopping now and then to look into the
shop windows, he pursued his unhurried way until
he reached the corner of the street opposite the
Moorlands Hotel.
</p>

<p>
Till that moment the problem of what to do
with his liberty had not crossed Mr. Bascombe's
mind.  His faculties had been wholly absorbed in
the delicious and unwonted sense of freedom to
which he had been so long a stranger.  But the
sight of that large gold-lettered inscription upon
the white building on the other side of the street
brought him back to more practical considerations.
It suggested to him that liberty, especially liberty
of such a precarious nature as his was likely to
prove, should be put to prompt and satisfactory
service.
</p>

<p>
Being a gentleman of action, he did not wait
upon his thoughts.  Moistening his lips, he crossed
the road, and still with the same deliberate dignity
mounted the two or three stone steps that led into
the hotel.
</p>

<p>
A large, fat-faced waiter who was standing just
inside saw him coming and pulled open the door of
the comfortably furnished lounge, bowing
obsequiously as he did so.  Mr. Bascombe entered, and
looked round with the air of a man well pleased
with his environment.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see the landlord," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
Again the waiter bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I will fetch him, sir.  Will you take a
seat for a moment?"
</p>

<p>
He indicated a large, comfortable-looking
ottoman upholstered in green leather.
</p>

<p>
With a little grunt of satisfaction Mr. Bascombe
settled himself down upon the article in question.
His enjoyment of its comfortable cushions was
heightened by the remembrance of the hard wooden
stool which for five years had constituted his only
form of sitting accommodation.  Half closing his
eyes, he leaned back in an attitude of luxurious
abandonment.  There was no one in the lounge
beside himself, the only sound that reached him
being a faint murmur of voices from the bar beyond
varied once by the sharp popping of a cork.  At
the latter noise a slow smile crept over the convict's
face, and once more he thoughtfully passed his
tongue across his lips.
</p>

<p>
His solitude was broken by the entrance of the
landlord, a cheery-looking little man with grey
side-whiskers and a slight stammer.
</p>

<p>
"G-good morning, sir," he began; "sorry to have
k-kept you waiting."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," replied Mr. Bascombe
graciously.  "I want to know if you can let me
have a room."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, sir&mdash;n-no difficulty about that.  Just
for the night, or will you be staying for a f-f-few
days?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm in no hurry," returned Mr. Bascombe,
stretching himself contentedly; then, thinking that
perhaps he ought to be more explicit, he added
with a touch of native humour, "It's pleasant to
to be in a comfortable hotel again after what I've
had to put up with lately."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, sir!" said the landlord.  "Perhaps
you're on a w-w-walking tour?"
</p>

<p>
He looked round as though expecting to see the
inevitable knapsack.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe interpreted the glance correctly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "that's it.  I've got my baggage
coming on by train."
</p>

<p>
The landlord nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing like walking light," he commented.
</p>

<p>
"You're right," said Mr. Bascombe, rising to his
feet.  "By the way, can I have something to eat?
It's a bit early, I know, but the fact is I didn't have
much of a breakfast this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Why, c-certainly, sir, of course.  Lunch won't
be ready till one o'clock, but you can have anything
c-c-cold, or a chop, or s-s-steak, if you pre-prefer it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! a steak will do me proud," said Mr. Bascombe
with enthusiasm.  "A big 'un for choice,
with plenty of potatoes."
</p>

<p>
"Anything to drink, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe paused a moment so as to let the
full beauty of the question sink into his
understanding.  Then he replied playfully:
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think a drop of Burgundy might help it
down."
</p>

<p>
The landlord, whose previous experience of
touring clergymen had led him to regard them as a
joyless and unprofitable brood, was delighted at
the mingled geniality and broad-mindedness of his
guest.  With a "Certainly, sir; I'll fetch it you
myself," he led the way across the lounge and
threw open the door of the coffee-room.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you'd like to g-go to your room first,
sir?" he suggested.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe cast a contemplative look at his
hands.
</p>

<p>
"I could do with a wash, couldn't I?" he
admitted cheerfully.  "Dirty work climbing these
hills."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we'll soon remedy that, sir!" laughed the
landlord.  He rang the bell, and an undersized
youth with a shock of red hair appeared from
somewhere in the back regions.
</p>

<p>
"T-t-take this gentleman up to Number Six,
Albert, and g-get him some hot water.  I'll order
your lunch, sir," he added.  "It will be ready
almost as soon as you are."
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later, with comparatively clean
hands and a superlatively acute appetite,
Mr. Bascombe re-entered the coffee-room.
</p>

<p>
The fat waiter, who was just putting the finishing
touches to a small table by the window, looked
up as he came in.
</p>

<p>
"I've laid your lunch 'ere, sir," he remarked.
"It's more cheerful like."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe regarded the preparations with
an approving eye.
</p>

<p>
"Good lad," he said, seating himself in the
comfortable arm-chair set out for him.  "This'll
just about suit my complaint.  Now you bung
along and hurry up the cook."
</p>

<p>
A momentary flicker of surprise illumined the
fat waiter's face, but with the true philosophy of
his order he recovered himself immediately.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," he remarked with an ingratiating
smile.  "Shan't keep you waiting a minute, sir."
</p>

<p>
He shuffled out into the kitchen, where he
repeated the phrase to the cook.
</p>

<p>
"Told me to bung along and 'urry up 'is dinner.
Fancy a parson speaking like that!"
</p>

<p>
"P'r'aps 'e's a Roman Catholic," suggested the cook.
</p>

<p>
Left to himself, Mr. Bascombe extracted a
toothpick from the wine-glass on the table, and,
leaning back in his chair, directed his gaze out of
the window.  He perceived at once that for some
reason or other the usually placid main thoroughfare
of Princetown was in a state of no little
animation.  Outside the grocer's shop opposite the
hotel a group of six or seven men and women stood
in the roadway talking eagerly and staring up the
street.  Their agitation seemed to be in some way
connected with the prison, for as a warder came
running hastily past they all turned and followed
him with their eyes.  Mr. Bascombe instinctively
pushed back his chair.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door of the coffee-room
swung open and the landlord hurried in, carrying a
bottle of Burgundy in his hand.  His face was
flushed and excited.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to have been so long, sir," he began,
"but the fact is we've had a b-b-bit of a shock.  A
warder has just been round to tell us that there's a
c-c-convict loose in Princetown."
</p>

<p>
"Gawd bless my soul!" cried Mr. Bascombe,
"you don't say so!"  Picking up the bottle of
Burgundy, he poured himself out a glass, and
drained it at a gulp.  "Give me quite a turn," he
explained, filling it up again.
</p>

<p>
The landlord regarded him sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I d-don't wonder.  The whole of
P-P-Princetown's in a rare state about it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe, who still seemed to be suffering
from the shock, raised his glass a second time and
took two or three long, deliberate sips.
</p>

<p>
"How did the beggar get away?" he inquired,
setting it down again with a deep breath.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, it seems as how, b-being a scene-painter
by trade, the warders had taken him down
to the Recreation Rooms to p-paint a bit o' stuff
for the p-p-play they're doing next week.  They
left him for a minute in the room behind the stage,
and when they came back they found he'd f-forced
the door and slipped out."
</p>

<p>
"Careless! careless!" interpolated Mr. Bascombe,
filling up his glass.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, but the amazing thing is, what's
happened to him?  Being in c-c-convict clothes,
one would think he must have been spotted
directly he showed his nose outside."
</p>

<p>
A slow smile stole across Mr. Bascombe's face.
</p>

<p>
"It's a fair puzzler," he admitted.  "If he'd got
some sort of a disguise like, now, one could
understand it; but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was a clatter of hoofs, and several
uniformed men on horseback galloped past the hotel.
The landlord ran to the window.
</p>

<p>
"There g-goes the civil g-g-guard," he stammered.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe again raised his glass.
</p>

<p>
"Here's luck to 'em!" he remarked generously.
</p>

<p>
As he drank the toast the fat waiter re-entered
bearing a well-laden tray, which he put down on
the neighbouring table.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Here's your lunch, sir," said the landlord.
"I told them to send you up the c-c-cold
tart and a bit of cheese as well.  I thought you'd
be able to manage a square meal after your walk."
</p>

<p>
"You thought correct," said Mr. Bascombe gratefully.
</p>

<p>
The waiter deposited a dish in front of him, and
removed the cover.  From a large steak, crowned
with little brown curls of onion, a most exquisite
flavour mounted into the air.  Mr. Bascombe
reverently transferred the entire pile to his own
plate, and then helped himself to a majestic hoard
of chipped potatoes.
</p>

<p>
"You're sure you've got everything you want,
sir?" inquired the landlord with unintentional
sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
His guest gazed meditatively round the table,
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think we might say a cigar, and a glass
of port wine to top up with," he observed.  "No
hurry about 'em."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bring them in, sir, if you'll just tell the
waiter when you're ready."
</p>

<p>
"Right-o," murmured Mr. Bascombe, lifting a
huge forkful to his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I fill your glass, sir?" inquired the waiter,
as the landlord departed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't stop here, Percy," he remarked
when the operation was completed.  "I can get
through this little lot on my own."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, sir," said the waiter.  "There's a
bell on the mantelpiece, sir, if you want me."
</p>

<p>
He withdrew to the kitchen, pondering darkly on
the unconventional habits of the Roman Catholic
clergy.
</p>

<p>
Unembarrassed by company, Mr. Bascombe
gave himself up without reserve to the enjoyment
of his meal.  Having finished the steak and
mopped up the gravy with a bit of bread, he
reluctantly pushed back his plate and turned his
attention to the tart.  Two generous helpings of this
luxury sufficed him, his repast concluding with a
slab of bread-and-cheese that must effectually have
filled up any spare corners remaining.
</p>

<p>
While he ate he kept an amused eye on the window,
noting the various symptoms of unrest which
were still apparent in the street.  It seemed as
though most of the able-bodied men in Princetown
were joining in the search.  Armed with sticks or
pitchforks, they came hurrying past one after another
to offer their services.  In every case Mr. Bascombe
gravely drank the health of the new arrival.
</p>

<p>
Finally, when the Burgundy was finished, he got
up a little unsteadily from the table and rang the
bell.  It was answered by the waiter.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe looked at him affectionately.
</p>

<p>
"'Ullo, Percy!" he remarked; "back again, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; you rang, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So I did.  You're quite right, Percy.  What
was it I wanted?"  His face brightened.  "Oh,
yes, the port wine and a cigar&mdash;the best quality
cigar, mark you.  None of your penny stinkers.
You tell old whiskers; he'll see to it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," murmured the waiter with a gasp.
</p>

<p>
He retired from the room, to be succeeded a
minute later by the landlord, bearing an aged-looking
black bottle in one hand and a large cigar-box
in the other.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you enjoyed your lunch, sir," he said,
placing these treasures on the table.
</p>

<p>
"First-rate," replied Mr. Bascombe, smacking
his lips.
</p>

<p>
"You found the wine all right, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe nodded humorously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he was hiding in the bottle, but I got him
out."
</p>

<p>
This witticism was much to the taste of the
landlord, who laughed uproariously.
</p>

<p>
"That's g-good, sir!  G-g-got him out!  Well,
I've got something here that I think you'll find the
right sort.  A drop of real g-g-genuine '58&mdash;c-c-comet
year, you know, sir.  I don't offer it to
many gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
He carefully poured out a glassful and held it up
to the light.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe sniffed it, took a long sip, and
then set down the wineglass with a wink.
</p>

<p>
"A little bit of orlright," was his verdict.
"Have a glass yourself, landlord?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir; I don't mind if I do."
</p>

<p>
While he was translating his words into action
Mr. Bascombe opened the cigar-box, which was
full of long, light brown Havanas.
</p>

<p>
"I d-don't know if these are too large, sir?"
observed the landlord.  "I can g-g-get you a
smaller brand if you pre-prefer it."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you trouble yourself," replied his
obliging guest.
</p>

<p>
He selected one, bit off the end, and, lighting it
with a match from a stand on the mantelpiece,
blew out a thick cloud of fragrant smoke.  It was
the supreme moment of his adventure.  He felt
that Fate had nothing more to offer him.
</p>

<p>
"N-no news of the convict yet, sir," remarked
the landlord.  "The whole of P-Princetown's out
hunting for him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mr. Bascombe with a chuckle.
"I've been watching 'em go by.  Very handy lot o'
chaps they looked."  He was silent for a moment,
then suddenly an idea&mdash;a terrific; dazzling
idea&mdash;flooded his imagination.  "Can you let me have a
carriage?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Why, c-certainly, sir.  How far are you thinking
of going?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe puffed thoughtfully at his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"I want to go and see the Governor of Princetown.
He's a pal o' mine, old Marshall is.  He'd
be cut up something horrid if he heard I'd gone
away without looking him up."
</p>

<p>
At the mention of Colonel Marshall's name the
landlord's respect for his unconventional visitor
visibly increased.
</p>

<p>
"I'll s-s-send out and order the victoria at once,
sir," he said.  "It's only about half a mile to the
Governor's house, but I expect you've had enough
walking for to-day."
</p>

<p>
"You're right," said Mr. Bascombe.  "Driving's
more my mark this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"And w-what train shall we meet your luggage
by, sir?  The six-thirty?"
</p>

<p>
This seemed as good a train as any other to the
owner of this imaginary encumbrance, so he
nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"Tell 'em to be careful with it, won't you?" he
added.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, sir!  That will be all right.  You'll be
wanting d-d-dinner, I suppose, sir?"
</p>

<p>
A sad, prophetic smile flitted across Mr. Bascombe's face.
</p>

<p>
"I expect I shall," he said simply.
</p>

<p>
An interval of about seven minutes ensued
between the landlord's departure and the clatter of
the victoria as it drew up at the front door.  That
this time was not wholly wasted by Mr. Bascombe
might have been gathered either from the reduced
weight of the port bottle or the increased unsteadiness
of his own gait as he crossed the hall.  He
managed to reach the vehicle without disaster,
however, and climbing in smiled a dignified
farewell at the landlord, who had come out to see him
off.
</p>

<p>
The latter watched his guest drive away with a
slightly puzzled expression.
</p>

<p>
"Blessed if I don't b-believe his Reverence had a
d-drop too much," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
His Reverence certainly had.  He lay back in
the victoria as it rolled up the main street feeling
immeasurably at peace with mankind.  A gracious
haze blurred the animated little groups of
women that still clustered in front of the doorways
and mellowed their excited chatter into a drowsy
and not unpleasing murmur.  Had the drive been
a few hundred yards longer he would probably
have arrived in a state of slumber, but the jerk of
the carriage as it drew up in front of the Governor's
gate just saved him from this social solecism.
He blinked doubtfully for a moment, and then,
recognizing his surroundings, clambered cautiously
out.
</p>

<p>
"Am I to wait, sir?" inquired the driver.
</p>

<p>
The question seemed to afford Mr. Bascombe
some amusement.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you wait, old sport," he replied; "shan't
be longer than I can help."
</p>

<p>
Then, before the astonished driver had recovered
from the shock of this unexpected address, he
pushed open the wooden gate that led into the
Governor's garden and advanced in graceful spirals
up the well-kept drive.  A vigorous pull at the
front-door bell resulted in the appearance of a
neat, dark-eyed housemaid.  Mr. Bascombe gazed
at her with approval.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, my dear," he remarked affably,
holding on to the doorpost to steady himself.  "Is
the Colonel at home?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the maid.
</p>

<p>
"Well, tell him that an old college friend of his
would like to see him."
</p>

<p>
For an instant the girl looked at him doubtfully;
then, reassured by the clerical costume, invited
him to step inside.  Abandoning his support with
extreme care, Mr. Bascombe followed her into a
comfortably-furnished study on the left-hand side
of the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Will you take a seat, sir?" she said.
</p>

<p>
The invitation was a shade superfluous, for his
legs having suddenly failed him, the visitor had
already sat down abruptly in a large easy chair
against the wall.
</p>

<p>
The uncertainty in the girl's face deepened into
dismay.
</p>

<p>
"I will tell Colonel Marshall you are here," she
said shortly, and with that she hastened from the
room, shutting the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe just had time to pull himself
together before the Governor entered.  Colonel
Marshall was a tall, soldierly-looking man with
upturned grey moustache and humorous eyes of a
keen blue.  The maid had evidently apprised him
of her experience, for he looked over his caller with
mingled curiosity, amusement, and suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," he said, "and what can I do for you?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bascombe, feeling that it would be tempting
Providence, made no attempt to rise.  He just sat
still and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know me?" he observed affably.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid not," said the Governor.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," replied Mr. Bascombe with a chuckle,
"that's the disguise, sir!"
</p>

<p>
Lifting up his hand he removed the wig.
</p>

<p>
The Governor stared at him for a moment in
amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!" he cried, "it's Bascombe!"
</p>

<p>
The convict bowed.
</p>

<p>
"You'll excuse my not getting up, sir.  No
intention of being disrespectful&mdash;been lunching at
the Moorlands Hotel."
</p>

<p>
The Governor sat down in a chair and burst into
a roar of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"You scoundrel!" he chuckled.  "You've given
us a nice chase.  Half the warders are out after
you now.  What on earth induced you to bolt,
and where did you get those clothes?"
</p>

<p>
He broke down again and shook with suppressed
merriment.
</p>

<p>
Thus adjured, Mr. Bascombe unfolded his story.
He told it quite simply, making no attempt to
apologize for his escape, or to seek avoidance in
any way of the punishment that awaited him.
The Governor listened with vast interest and
amusement, his sense of humour temporarily
overcoming the amazing irregularity of the whole
proceedings.  When Mr. Bascombe described his
lunch, and the production of the '58 port, he lay
back in his chair and laughed till the tears ran
down his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Finally, when the narrative was finished, he got up.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Bascombe," he said, with a smile,
"you've had your fun, and now you've got to pay
for it."
</p>

<p>
The convict, who was beginning to feel better,
rose instantly to his feet and saluted.
</p>

<p>
The Governor not unkindly laid his hand upon
the old sinner's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"You're a disgrace to the prison, Bascombe,"
he said, "but I'll do my best for you."
</p>

<p>
And Colonel Marshall kept his word.
</p>

<h3>
The Nadir Bandar
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I had known Bruce for about fifteen years before
this amazing thing happened.
</p>

<p>
He was a nephew of Mervyn Bruce, the famous
traveller, and we had turned up the same day at
Haileybury&mdash;two forlorn new boys.  I can see
him now with his shock of red hair, his friendly
grin, and that funny little habit of scratching the
back of his right ear which has never left him.
</p>

<p>
He came up and spoke to me in the quad.
Some big fellow had just asked me my name, and
when in all innocence I had said, "Bridges&mdash;what's
yours?"  I had been answered with a clip over the
head that had sent me sprawling on the asphalt.
</p>

<p>
"Why did he hit you?" asked Bruce.
</p>

<p>
I explained, trying not to blubber.
</p>

<p>
"You'll know him again, won't you?" said
Bruce.
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," he said cheerfully.  "Then
you can poison his food."
</p>

<p>
I remember this struck me as being a very
comforting reflection, and from that moment Bruce
and I have always been the best of friends.
</p>

<p>
Later on we shared a study together, the corner
study next "the big school," and one summer
holiday I went and stayed with his people in that
big, ivy-covered house near Goring that you can
see from the railway line.
</p>

<p>
When we left school our paths separated for a
time.  I started at journalism in London, while
Bruce was sent to France "to learn the language."  I
think his father had some idea that he would
make a good Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
When the old man died, Bruce came home and
settled in London.  He had come into about Â£800
a year, and had no intention at all of going into
politics.
</p>

<p>
Since then we have always seen a good deal of
each other.  He is just the same cheery,
irresponsible, adventurous, good-natured chap that he
was at school.  I don't think we ever had anything
approaching a quarrel in our lives.
</p>

<p>
I have told you all this so that you can see
exactly what sort of people we are.  It's really
quite unnecessary, because you won't believe my
story in any case.  Still, unless Bruce and I are
insane, the thing really happened; and as there is
absolutely no reason to suppose we are, I intend
to tell it and get it off my chest.
</p>

<p>
I will begin right at the beginning.  It was on
the 9th of February that I first learned of Mervyn
Bruce's death.  I saw it in the <i>Daily Mail</i> while I
was having breakfast.  There was a portrait of
him in rough shooting clothes and a cork helmet&mdash;it
must have been taken many years before&mdash;and a
full column about his life and adventures.  He had
died at Etretat, where the paper said he had been
living for some time.
</p>

<p>
I didn't bother myself about it, because I knew
that he and Bruce had not been on speaking terms
for years.  There had been some silly family
squabble somewhere back in the dark ages, and
the old explorer was one of those fatuous people
who think it a point of honour to keep a thing like
that up for ever.  So, after making an ineffectual
attempt at a reconciliation when he was in France,
Bruce had simply let matters slide.
</p>

<p>
I was therefore a little surprised to get a line
from him on the 11th, saying that he was just off to
Etretat, to see about his uncle's funeral.  "The
fact is," he wrote, "the old chap had quarrelled
with everyone by the time he died, and as I'm his
nearest relation I suppose I ought to see him
through.  I shall be back by the end of the week."
</p>

<p>
It was six days before I heard anything more.
Then, late on Tuesday evening, I received a wire
from him at the office:
</p>

<p>
"Please come Hampstead to-morrow&mdash;lunch.
Important."
</p>

<p>
Bruce lives in one of those old-fashioned
three-storey houses away to the right off the top of
Haverstock Hill.  I expect you know them if you
have ever been up in that direction.  Standing
back from the road, with balconies, long windows,
and creeper-covered fronts, they seem to shrink in
a kind of desolate dismay from the new red-brick
splendour which has gradually hemmed them in.
</p>

<p>
Heath View, the end one, is where Bruce hangs
out.  It belongs to an ex-police sergeant and his
wife, called Jones, and Bruce has the whole of the
two top floors.  They make him very comfortable,
but I have often wondered why he doesn't take a
flat.  He says it is because Mrs. Jones is the only
woman in London who can cook a mushroom
omelette.
</p>

<p>
When I rang the bell the possessor of this unique
talent opened the door herself.  She is a tall,
good-looking woman of about forty, with that sort of grave,
respectful manner you don't often meet nowadays.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Mr. Bruce was in, she said, and expecting
me.  Would I go straight up?
</p>

<p>
Bruce heard me coming, and flung open the
door.  He had just jumped up from his desk,
which was littered with papers and bundles of
deeds tied up by red tape.  He looked flushed and
a little excited.
</p>

<p>
"Come along in," he said.  "I was just beginning
to be afraid you couldn't turn up."
</p>

<p>
I discarded my coat, and followed him into the room.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't neglect such a poignant wire," I
said.  "What's the matter?  Have you come into
a fortune?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed in a curious jerky sort of way, and
just then Mrs. Jones came in and began to lay the
table for lunch.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had gone down again, Bruce
walked across to the fire-place, and threw down his
cigarette in the grate.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't get any money," he said abruptly.
"The old chap left every cent he had to Reardon,
the man who published his book of travels."
</p>

<p>
"I should dispute the will," I said.  "An
author who leaves money to a publisher is
obviously mad."
</p>

<p>
Bruce scratched his ear for a moment in silence.
</p>

<p>
"I've got something else, though," he said at
last.  Then he stepped to his desk, pulled open
the drawer, and took out a small, dark green
object.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it?" he said, handing it
to me.
</p>

<p>
I took it, and crossed to the window so as to get
it in a better light.
</p>

<p>
I am not a particularly impressionable person,
but when I saw it at close quarters I as nearly as
possible dropped it.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens," I said, "what a loathsome
thing!  What is it?  A monkey or a devil?"
</p>

<p>
Bruce laughed uneasily.  "It's the Nadir
Bandar," he said.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door opened, and Mrs. Jones
came in again with a mushroom omelette.
I stuffed the infernal piece of jade away in my
pocket, and we sat down at the table.  It was not
until she had shut the door behind her that I took
it out.
</p>

<p>
"And what the devil is the Nadir Bandar when
it's at home?" I asked, setting the horrible thing
up on the tablecloth in front of me.
</p>

<p>
Bruce laid down his fork, and, putting his hand
in his pocket, pulled out a couple of sheets of dirty
folded foolscap.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better read that," he said'.
</p>

<p>
I took them with no little curiosity.  They were
written in a very fine sloping hand, and were
headed: "An Account of the Finding of the Nadir
Bandar.  Not to be published until after my
death.&mdash;MERVYN BRUCE."
</p>

<p>
Here is the whole thing as it was written:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I first heard of the Nadir Bandar when I was
at Nikh in '73.  I was told of it by the Sheikh
Al-Abbas, who claimed himself to be descended
from Nadir Shah.
</p>

<p>
"Al-Abbas had been wounded in the rebellion
against Nasr-ed-Din, and had fled to Nikh, where
I found him dying and in disguise.  I took him
into my house and looked after him as well as I
could, for the man was a great man of noble blood,
and not an accursed Turkish dog like Nasr-ed-Din.
</p>

<p>
"On the night before he died he spoke to me of
the Nadir Bandar.
</p>

<p>
"'If I had it,' he said, 'I would wish to be well,
and I would also wish that Nasr-ed-Din should be
eaten of worms.'
</p>

<p>
"Myself: 'What is the Nadir Bandar, Sheikh
Al-Abbas?  I have not heard of it.'
</p>

<p>
"The Sheikh: 'There is but one who has heard of
it, and he will die with the coming of the sun.'
</p>

<p>
"Myself: 'It is a great power if it can grant such
wishes as you name.'
</p>

<p>
"The Sheikh: 'There is no wish that it cannot
grant.  Four times may a man call upon it and
four times will it answer.  With its aid my
ancestor, Nadir Shah, conquered the entire
world.'
</p>

<p>
"Myself: 'If he possessed such a power, Sheikh
Al-Abbas, why did he allow himself to be slain?'
</p>

<p>
"The Sheikh: 'Four times had he called on it
and four times had it answered.'
</p>

<p>
"Myself: 'You mean that its power had passed
away?'
</p>

<p>
"The Sheikh: 'He had buried it at the meeting of
the waters.  His last wish had been that he might
win the world and gain the mountain of light.
When this was granted he buried it beneath the
great sun stone at the meeting of the waters.
After that he was slain.'
</p>

<p>
"Myself: 'And where is the meeting of the
waters, Sheikh Al-Abbas?'
</p>

<p>
"The Sheikh: 'I cannot say.  All that I know
I was told by my father, who had had it from his
father before him.'
</p>

<p>
"When I rose next morning the Sheikh Al-Abbas
was dead.  I buried him, pondering greatly
over his story.  Some would have dismissed it
from their minds as the babbling of a dying man,
but I have seen many strange things in this world,
and I knew well that the Sheikh Al-Abbas had
spoken what he believed to be true.
</p>

<p>
"So soon as I could get away from Nikh in
safety I travelled through to Quetta, and, there
procuring a map, I traced out the marches of
Nadir Shah, as he came back from the ravishing of
Delhi.  So far as I could see there was but one
place to which the phrase used by the Sheikh
Al-Abbas could be applied.  That was a few miles
to the east of Jelalabad, where the Chitral and
Kabul rivers mingle together and flow down to the
great lakes.
</p>

<p>
"I made my way up to Peshawar, and in the
disguise of an Afghan hillman crossed the border.
At Lalpura I fell in with a travelling merchant,
who was in much fear of being waylaid by robbers.
'Two,' said he, 'are better company than one.'  And
together we set out on the road to Jelalabad.
</p>

<p>
"We passed through Kila Akhund before the
sun was high in the sky, and halted for our midday
rest on the bank of the Kabul river.  It was there
that I learned of the Temple of the Sun Stone.
</p>

<p>
"It stood before us at the meeting of the waters,
a low stone building set on an island in mid-stream.
</p>

<p>
"When my companion spoke of it by its name
my heart leaped suddenly within me, for I recalled
the words of the Sheikh Al-Abbas.
</p>

<p>
"'It is very sacred,' said my companion.  'No
one but the priests of the Sun are allowed to enter
or even to land on the island.'
</p>

<p>
"I made no reply to him, and later on we continued
our journey to Jelalabad, where we parted.
</p>

<p>
"That night I rode out from the city, and tied
up my horse in a thicket on the bank of the river
opposite to the temple.  Then, stripping myself of
my clothes, I entered the water and swam to the
island, having some matches and a loaded pistol
in my turban.  These I took out on landing, and
advanced very carefully towards the gate of the
temple.
</p>

<p>
"It was shut, and I could find no means of
opening it save by breaking it in with a stone.
This I did, waiting in some anxiety to see what
might happen.  There was no sound or movement,
and I entered.  The temple was quite dark inside;
so, halting and striking a match, I held it up above
my head and looked about me.
</p>

<p>
"The floor was of beaten earth, and at the further
end I beheld a large red stone, as red as blood,
and guarded by golden rails.  There were two
candles, one each side, set in brass candlesticks.
</p>

<p>
"These I lighted, and then without more ado
set to work, digging out the earth under the stone
with the aid of my knife.  I must have laboured
for the best part of an hour before the steel struck
upon something hard, and the blade snapped in my
hand.  In another minute I had dragged to light
an ancient iron box, which had rusted fully as red
as the stone above.  The cover fell off as I lifted it,
and inside I beheld the Nadir Bandar.
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely had I taken it in my hand, when the
door of the temple opened.  I looked up quickly.
In the gloom I could see three figures, tall men
robed in white, and carrying swords.
</p>

<p>
"I raised my pistol, but as I did so the words of
the Sheikh Al-Abbas came flooding into my mind.
'I wish,' said I clearly and without hesitation,
'that I was in Peshawar.'
</p>

<p>
"For a moment my eyes closed.  When I
opened them I was standing outside the house in
Peshawar where I had lately lodged."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At this point I laid down the manuscript and
burst into a shout of laughter.
</p>

<p>
Bruce leaned across and picked it up.  "You
think it's all nonsense?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said I, "that as an explorer your
uncle can give points to Louis de Rougemont and
Dr. Cook.  The picture of him suddenly appearing
naked in the main street of Peshawar, with a
pistol in one hand and the Nadir Bandar in the
other, is about the richest touch of imagination
I've ever struck."
</p>

<p>
"You think it's all a lie?" persisted Bruce.
</p>

<p>
I stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap," I said, "it's either a lie or else
the old boy was as mad as a March hare.  Considering
he left his money to a publisher, I personally
incline to the latter theory."
</p>

<p>
Bruce sat silent for a minute, scratching his ear.
Then he laughed in a rather apologetic sort of
fashion.
</p>

<p>
"You'll think I'm dotty, too," he said, "but do
you know, upon my soul, I believe there's
something in it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, get out!" I said; "and pass me the whisky."
</p>

<p>
Bruce handed over the bottle.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not joking," he went on obstinately.
"I've got a funny sort of feeling that the old chap
was speaking the truth."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to take something for it," I said.
"Mother Seigel or Dr. William's Pink Pills for
Neurotic Nephews."
</p>

<p>
Bruce got up, and, crossing to the mantelpiece,
began to fill a pipe.  For some moments we both
remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"Well, look here," he broke out at last rather
awkwardly, "I'm going to have a wish and see
what happens."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head with a kind of mock disapproval.
</p>

<p>
"You're sure to be sorry," I said.  "These
things always turn out badly.  Think of 'Uncle
Peter's Fairy Story.'"
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" asked Bruce.
</p>

<p>
"It's a book," I replied, "a book that delighted
my early childhood.  As far as I can recollect,
everyone in it was allowed to have one wish, and
the results were&mdash;well, not quite what they
expected.  I remember one kind-hearted lady
wishing that the blacksmith's baby, who was dying
of consumption, should be as well and strong as its
father.  In about three minutes the baby was
decimating the village with a sledge-hammer."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very careful," remarked Bruce, a
little uncomfortably.  "I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By the way," I interrupted, "what happened
to your uncle?  You took away his manuscript
before I'd finished it."
</p>

<p>
"He never had any more wishes," said Bruce.
"That first shot seems to have frightened him off
it."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder," I said.  "One experience like
that would be enough to make me sign the pledge
for ever."
</p>

<p>
Bruce came to the table and picked up the Nadir
Bandar.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to wish?" I asked
mischievously.  "For goodness' sake be careful."
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," he answered.  "I've got four
wishes, so I can always unwish one if it goes
wrong."
</p>

<p>
Then he paused.
</p>

<p>
"I wish," he said, very slowly and distinctly,
"that I may be irresistible to all women."
</p>

<p>
I burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens," I said, "you've done it now!
Think what will happen if you run up against a
girls' school!  What on earth made you wish
that?"
</p>

<p>
An obstinate look came into Bruce's face.
</p>

<p>
"It's Cynthia," he said.  "Cynthia West, you
know.  I want to marry her, and she won't give up
the stage."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you needn't have indulged in quite such a
sweeping demand," I protested.
</p>

<p>
Bruce looked a little ashamed.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I'd be on the safe side," he explained.
"You see, I might get tired of Cynthia one day,
and then it would save wasting a second wish."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm blessed!" I said.  "For a lover I
think you're about the most cold-blooded cynic I
ever struck.  What are you going to wish next?"
</p>

<p>
"I must have some money," Bruce said thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"You must," I agreed, "plenty!  Eight hundred
a year won't go far with Cynthia, to say
nothing of the others."
</p>

<p>
"What about a billion in Consols?" suggested
Bruce.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"Too much," I said.  "Think what <i>The Clarion</i>
and <i>Reynolds's</i> would say about it!  You'd have
no peace."
</p>

<p>
"I know," exclaimed Bruce suddenly.  "I'll
wish that I had as much money as John P. Fox, the
American Rubber King."
</p>

<p>
"That ought to see you through all right," I
remarked approvingly.  "The papers say he is
worth six millions."
</p>

<p>
Bruce again held up the Nadir Bandar.
</p>

<p>
"I wish," said he, "that I had as much money as
John P. Fox, the American Rubber King."
</p>

<p>
"Two up and one to play," I said, laughing.
"You may as well have a third while you're about
it; that will still leave you one to hedge with."
</p>

<p>
Bruce thought a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I wish that I may live for ever," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" I cried.  "You'll be able to read Hall
Caine's next novel right through."
</p>

<p>
With this hopeful reflection I got up from my
chair and walked to the window.
</p>

<p>
"Now this tomfoolery's over," I observed, with
a yawn, "what are we going to do?"
</p>

<p>
Bruce scratched his ear.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go and call on Cynthia, I think," he
said in a rather apologetic voice.  "After all, you
know," he added lamely, "there might be
something in it."
</p>

<p>
"Superstition," I began, "when coupled with&mdash;"  Then
I stopped abruptly.  The excellent aphorism
that I was about to utter was never completed.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" asked Bruce, turning to me in
surprise.
</p>

<p>
I pointed to the door of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Look at that," I said.
</p>

<p>
It was opening, slowly and stealthily, without a
sound.
</p>

<p>
We stared at it in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Who's there?" called out Bruce sharply.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause, and then, very
quietly, Mrs. Jones slipped into the room and shut
the door behind her.  She was breathing quickly,
and her face was curiously flushed.
</p>

<p>
For several seconds we all three stood facing
each other.  Then Bruce spoke.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Mrs. Jones?  Are you
ill?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The woman made no reply.  With her eyes half
closed, she rocked slowly from side to side as if
about to fall.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" I cried.  "She's going to faint!"
</p>

<p>
We both sprang forward together, but Bruce
got there first and caught her by the shoulders.
In a flash she had clutched him, winding her arms
round his waist, and burying her face in his coat
with a little cry, half-way between a laugh and a
sob.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Bruce was too dumbfounded to
resist.  Then, with frantic energy, he made a
vain attempt to disentangle himself from her
embrace.
</p>

<p>
"Here, let me go!" he stammered.  "What
are you doing?  What's the matter?  Pull her off,
Bridges&mdash;pull her off!"
</p>

<p>
I hastened to his assistance, feeling as if I was
taking part in some exceptionally spirited nightmare.
</p>

<p>
To and fro we swayed, pulling, struggling, and
banging against the table.  At last, with a mighty
heave, I managed to unfasten one of her hands, and,
ducking down, Bruce tore himself free.
</p>

<p>
"She's mad!" he gasped.  "Shove her outside,
and lock the door, quick!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, give us a hand, then!" I panted, for the
woman was twisting and writhing in a manner
that made it almost impossible to hold her.
</p>

<p>
Watching his opportunity, Bruce leaped in and
seized her disengaged wrist.  She fought furiously
but together we half pushed, half carried her into
the passage, and then, wrenching ourselves loose,
leaped back into the room and slammed and locked
the door.
</p>

<p>
I sank down on the sofa and gazed at Bruce, who
leaned against a table, mopping his forehead with
a handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
Presently he found his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Lord!" he muttered in an awestruck whisper.
"I never thought the darn thing would work like
this!"
</p>

<p>
That revived me.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be an idiot!" I cried sharply.  "You
don't suppose it's got anything to do with your
beastly green monkey?  The wretched woman's
gone clean off her head.  Something must be done
at once."
</p>

<p>
At that moment there came a savage hammering
on the panels of the door.
</p>

<p>
"I know what I'm going to do!" exclaimed
Bruce hastily, "and that's get out of the window.
She'll have Jones up in a moment if she goes on like
that, and the man's as jealous as Satan.  He'd kill
me for a certainty before I had time to explain."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not going to be left here with a couple
of gibbering lunatics!" I protested, jumping up
from the sofa.
</p>

<p>
He caught me by the sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Come on then; we can get out on the balcony
and climb down by the ivy.  Anything's better
than waiting for Jones."
</p>

<p>
By this time I was so bewildered that I think I
should have fallen in with any suggestion,
however ludicrous.  I remember some vague wonder
passing through my mind as to what the next-door
people would think if they saw us swarming
down the front of the house; but with the door
threatening to yield every instant before
Mrs. Jones's frantic assault, there was no opportunity
for detached reflection.  Grabbing my hat from
the table, I followed Bruce out on to the balcony,
shutting the window behind me.  One glance
up and down showed us that the road was
empty.
</p>

<p>
"You go first," I said unselfishly; "you're in
most danger."
</p>

<p>
He climbed the rail, and, clutching the stems of
the ivy with both hands, slid off into space.
Leaning over, I watched him swaying downwards in
short, spasmodic jerks.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly from within the room came the crash
of a splintering panel.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" I yelled hurriedly.  "I'm coming!"  And,
scrambling over the rail, I, too, committed
myself to that inadequate creeper.
</p>

<p>
I know that in books of adventure people swarm
up and down an ivy-clad house without the faintest
inconvenience, but as one who has tried it, I
can only say that it's about the most poisonously
impossible feat ever attempted.
</p>

<p>
Bruce was luckier than I.  He was within four
feet of the ground when the stuff gave way; I
must have fallen at least twelve.  And I landed in
a rose bush.
</p>

<p>
Bruce, who had scrambled to his feet, rushed up
and pulled me out of the wreckage.
</p>

<p>
"Hurt?" he inquired eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I replied with some bitterness, "not
in the least!  I love to come down sitting on a rose
bush.  It's a kind of hobby of mine."
</p>

<p>
We had no time to squabble, however.  Before
Bruce could answer, we heard the window
above flung violently open, and the furious
panting of Mrs. Jones, as she climbed out on to the
balcony.
</p>

<p>
That was enough.  With incredible celerity we
dashed for the garden gate, and nearly killed
ourselves trying to get out at the same moment.
Then, turning to the right, we raced down the road
towards Haverstock Hill.
</p>

<p>
We must have covered at least half the distance
before I regained sufficient sanity to realize what
we were doing.  Then I clutched Bruce by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Steady on!" I gasped.  "If there's any one
looking they'll think we're mad!"
</p>

<p>
Even as I spoke there came a sharp "teuf teuf!"
and instinctively we pulled up.  Round the corner
of Fitz-John Villas bowled a solitary taxi, the
driver leaning back comfortably in his seat and
smoking a big cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Hi!" we yelled in unison.
</p>

<p>
Some note of unusual urgency in our summons
must have attracted him, for he at once applied
his brakes.  Having done this, however, he
recollected himself, and, removing his cigar, spat
pleasantly in the roadway.
</p>

<p>
"Nothin' doin', guv'nor!" he said, with a kind of
gloomy satisfaction.  "Just orf to the garrige."
</p>

<p>
"You must!" I said desperately.  "We're in a
hurry, we can't wait!  I'll give you a sovereign!"
</p>

<p>
"A suvrin!" he repeated dully.  "Where d'yer
want to go to?"
</p>

<p>
"Piccadilly Circus," I blurted out.  It was the
first place that came into my head.
</p>

<p>
He stared at me, and then something like a look
of sympathy crept into his face.
</p>

<p>
"Ar!" he said.  "Git in."
</p>

<p>
For about three minutes after the taxi started
neither of us spoke.  Then Bruce broke the
silence.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "d'you believe it now?"
</p>

<p>
I turned on him angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," I cried, "don't talk blithering rot!
The thing's impossible!  You know it as well as I do!"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what about Mrs. Jones?" he said obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Jones," I repeated, "is the victim of the
same disease that you're suffering from&mdash;common
or garden hysteria.  No doubt she was listening
at the door, and overheard your tomfool nonsense
with that ridiculous monkey.  Being a highly
strung, passionate sort of woman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Bruce cut me short.
</p>

<p>
"Jones," he said, "is always complaining that
she's too cold."
</p>

<p>
"Cold!" I groaned.  "Oh, Lord!"
</p>

<p>
"So it couldn't be that," he added.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if it isn't that," I said, "what the blazes
is it?  You don't seriously expect me to believe in
black magic and Mumbo Jumbo and all that sort
of bunkum, do you?"
</p>

<p>
Bruce scratched his ear.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," he said unhappily.
</p>

<p>
We sat in silence as the cab ran on, each of us
staring out of the window on our respective sides.
It was not until we were halfway up Tottenham
Court Road that I suddenly noticed the time.
There was a big clock outside one of the furniture
shops, and the hands were pointing to half-past two.
I called Bruce's attention to the fact.
</p>

<p>
"Cynthia won't have finished her lunch yet," I
said.  "We had better get out at Piccadilly
Circus and walk up.  Or perhaps you'd rather go
alone?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered eagerly; "I want you to
come.  You needn't stay, you know, but I'd like
you just to come and see what happens."
</p>

<p>
"All right," I said, with a laugh.  "I may as
well see you through now I've begun.  If Cynthia
starts embracing you, I'll leave the room."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't joke about it!" said Bruce nervously.
</p>

<p>
The cab swerved its way through the traffic in
Piccadilly Circus, and drew up with a jerk opposite
Swan and Edgar's.  We got out, and I handed the
man a sovereign which I had ready.
</p>

<p>
He took it with a friendly smile.
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye, sir," he said, "an' good luck."
</p>

<p>
"It's my cab," said Bruce, as we turned into
Regent Street.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I answered, "we won't fight about
it.  You can pay me as soon as your green monkey
pushes along those six millions."
</p>

<p>
By this time we were just opposite the entrance
to the Piccadilly Hotel.  As we passed, the door
swung open, and a handsome woman, dressed in
a long sable cloak, stepped out on to the pavement.
In the roadway opposite, a liveried manservant
was holding open the door of a smart electric
brougham.
</p>

<p>
At the sight of us she paused, and her lips parted
in one of the sweetest smiles I have ever seen.  We
both took off our hats, but as Bruce made no
attempt to stop I walked on with him.
</p>

<p>
"Who is she?" I whispered.
</p>

<p>
He stared at me.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," he said.  "I thought she was a
friend of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Never seen her in my life," I answered.  "I
wonder who she took us for?"
</p>

<p>
I looked round, and then touched his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Bruce," I said, "she's following us."
</p>

<p>
He glanced bade over his shoulder, and I saw
him start as though something had stung him.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" he muttered, suddenly quickening
his pace.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what does it matter?" I protested.
</p>

<p>
"Others, too," he whispered, "just behind her!
Three or four of 'em!  It's that infernal charm!"
</p>

<p>
"Bosh!" I said incredulously, and then turned
round to take another look.  For a moment I felt
as if someone had suddenly placed a large piece of
ice inside my waistcoat.  At least five women
were following us along the pavement, headed by
the lady in sables.  There could be no possible
doubt about it.  Even as I looked two girls who
had been walking in the other direction suddenly
pulled up, and then, turning round, came hurriedly
in pursuit of the rest.  We seemed to be clearing
Regent Street.
</p>

<p>
"This is awful!" I gasped.  "What are we to do?"
</p>

<p>
"We must t-take a taxi!" stammered Bruce,
looking wildly about him.
</p>

<p>
Of course, as luck would have it, there was not
a cab of any kind passing.  We couldn't wait,
for every moment things were growing worse.
Women were appearing suddenly out of shops, and
hurrying over from the other side of the street in
twos and threes, recklessly indifferent to the traffic.
In less than a minute a jostling crowd of about
fifty or sixty were sweeping after us up the pavement.
</p>

<p>
"Run!" gasped Bruce.  "Run!"
</p>

<p>
It was, of course, about as mad a thing as we
could have done; but panic, stark, blind panic, had
gripped hold of us, and our only feeling was a
frantic desire to escape.  Without another word
we took to our heels.
</p>

<p>
Of what followed I have a somewhat confused
recollection.  I remember a terrific uproar all
round us, yells of "Suffragettes!" "Stop 'em!"
"Police!"  And then two helmeted figures in dark
blue suddenly leaped across our path.  I suppose
they must have taken us for Cabinet Ministers, for
they opened out to let us go through, and without
hesitation hurled themselves into the wild
avalanche of pursuing women.
</p>

<p>
The check was only a momentary, one, but it
saved us.  Before the shattered column could
reform we had reached the corner of Vigo Street,
where a taxi&mdash;a thrice-blessed taxi with an excited,
beckoning driver at the wheel&mdash;was standing in
readiness.
</p>

<p>
"Jump in!" he roared, as we hurled ourselves
panting at the door.
</p>

<p>
Willing hands banged it behind us, someone
raised a cheer as we sank back on the seat, and
there we were spinning past the Bodley Head,
with the tumult and shouting dying away behind us.
</p>

<p>
There are some emotions which words are quite
inadequate to express.  At that moment Bruce
and I were suffering from about six of them.
</p>

<p>
It was the taxi-driver who first broke the silence.
At the bottom of Bond Street he pulled up, and,
projecting his head round the side of the cab,
signified his desire to speak with us.
Mechanically I pulled down the window.
</p>

<p>
"The 'Ouse of Commons, guv'nor?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No," I said dully; "Cynthia's flat."
</p>

<p>
He stared at me, and I recollected myself.
</p>

<p>
"Manor Court, Marylebone Road," I observed
harshly.
</p>

<p>
He spun round and we retraced our way up Bond
Street.
</p>

<p>
Just as we were emerging from the bottom of
Harley Street, Bruce leaned across and laid his
hand on my arm.
</p>

<p>
"After I've seen Cynthia," he said brokenly,
"I shall unwish that first wish."
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
The taxi drew up at the gate of Manor Court
and we got out.
</p>

<p>
The driver looked at us with interest.
</p>

<p>
"Just in time, I was," he observed; "they'd
'ave 'ad you in another minit."
</p>

<p>
Bruce handed him half a sovereign.
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye, sir," he said, "thank ye."  Then he
paused.  "I knows wot them suffrinjettes wants,"
he added, "and if I 'ad my way I'd give it 'em."
</p>

<p>
With this dark saying he slipped in his clutch
and left us.
</p>

<p>
Side by side we walked up the gravelled drive
and stepped in through the main entrance.
</p>

<p>
Cynthia's flat is on the ground floor on the
right-hand side, the one with the green door and
the copper knocker.  Bruce laid his hand on the
latter, and then hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," I said bitterly.  "Think what we've
been through."
</p>

<p>
His face hardened and he gave two sharp rattats.
</p>

<p>
A minute's pause, a sound of footsteps, and then
the door swung open.  A pretty, dark girl in the
dress of a parlourmaid was standing before us.
</p>

<p>
Bruce cleared his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Is Miss West at home?" he asked huskily.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him curiously for a moment without
replying, then suddenly she said: "Yes, sir,"
and stepped back from the door.
</p>

<p>
We followed her into the hall, laying our hats
and sticks on the table inside.  Bruce's hands
were shaking like leaves.
</p>

<p>
Without looking at us the girl led the way down
the passage and opened a door on the left-hand
side.
</p>

<p>
"Will you please come in here, sir?" she said
gently.
</p>

<p>
Bruce, who was about two paces ahead of me,
stepped in first.  In a flash the girl had followed
him, slamming the door in my face with a bang
that echoed through the flat.
</p>

<p>
I pulled up short, and as I did so there came a
stifled cry from Bruce:
</p>

<p>
"Help, help, Bridges, help!"
</p>

<p>
Flinging open the door again, I rushed in.  As
far as I could see, Bruce and the housemaid were
engaged in a rather strenuous waltz.  They were
swaying down the room wreathed in each other's
arms, splendidly regardless of the furniture.  Even
as I entered, they fetched up against the end of the
sofa, and collapsed into a tangled heap.
</p>

<p>
At that instant something heavy struck me
violently in the back and sent me reeling against
the wall.  A big woman in a print dress, her arms
covered with flour, and a rolling-pin in her hand,
brushed violently past me.  In two strides she
reached the sofa, and, seizing hold of the dark girl,
began to drag her away from Bruce.  If the latter's
collar had not given way he would certainly
have been choked.  As it was, the stud broke just
in the nick of time.
</p>

<p>
The two women reached the floor together with
a loud thud, the rolling-pin clattering away across
the room.  Next moment, collarless and
dishevelled, Bruce was leaping for the door.
</p>

<p>
I followed him, grabbing the handle, and slamming
it behind me.  As luck would have it, there
was a lock outside; and while Bruce snatched up
his hat and fumbled with the front door, I turned
the key with a savage force that broke it off
short in my hand.  Then, like two drunken men,
we fell rather than staggered out into the main
hall.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, there was no one about.  Panting
and exhausted, we leaned against the foot of the
lift, while Bruce, by turning up his collar and
brushing his coat with one hand, made a feeble
attempt to regain some semblance of respectability.
</p>

<p>
We were interrupted by the crunch of footsteps
on the drive outside.
</p>

<p>
"Look out," I whispered hastily; "here's
someone coming."
</p>

<p>
Bruce straightened himself just as a burly porter
in uniform swung in through the doorway.  He
evidently recognized us as friends of Cynthia, for
he saluted with a friendly but respectful smile.
</p>

<p>
"Good-day, gen'lemen," he remarked.  "I'm
afraid Miss West ain't in town.  Gone to Reigate,
so I understand.  P'rhaps you've seen the
parlourmaid?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded my head.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said; "we've seen the parlourmaid.
Could you get us a cab?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, sir; taxi, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter," interrupted Bruce in a
dazed voice, "as long as there are no women
in it."
</p>

<p>
I nudged him warningly, but the porter, evidently
taking him for a humourist, laughed heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, sir," he said briskly; "I'll see to
that, sir."  Then, pulling a whistle from under
his uniform, he stepped outside and blew a shrill
blast.  Almost immediately a taxi rolled up the
drive.
</p>

<p>
The porter opened the door; and as we came
down the steps to get in, a small boy with a bundle
of newspapers under his arm dashed up and thrust
one out before me.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere y'are, sir; two-thirty winner.  Death of a
well-known millionaire, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Push off, me lad," said the porter grandly.
</p>

<p>
I had pulled a penny out of my pocket, however,
before he spoke, and with an <i>Evening News</i> in my
hand I followed Bruce into the taxi.
</p>

<p>
"Where to, sir?" inquired the porter.
</p>

<p>
For a moment I was floored.
</p>

<p>
"The Bachelors' Club," said Bruce, handing
him a shilling.
</p>

<p>
The porter saluted and passed on the instructions.
</p>

<p>
"Bruce," I said dully, "do you realize what
we're spending in cabs?"
</p>

<p>
Bruce shook his head with an air of utter weariness.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter," he said.  "I've got six
million somewhere."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour earlier I should have laughed.  As
it was I only stared at him stupidly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.  "I suppose you have."
</p>

<p>
Then, in a sort of mechanical way, I opened the
paper.
</p>

<p>
For a moment I gazed at it like a man in a
trance.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" asked Bruce.
</p>

<p>
I was past speaking.  I could only point with a
trembling finger to the three huge headlines which
seemed to dance mockingly across the page:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "SUICIDE OF JOHN P. FOX.<br />
  RUINED RUBBER KING BLOWS OUT HIS BRAINS.<br />
  PAUPER FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Bruce read them aloud in a strange, dry voice.
Then he burst out into a horrid, cackling, mad sort
of laugh.
</p>

<p>
"That's done it!" he cried.  "No money, and
this nightmare of a day for ever!"  His voice rose
to a scream.  "I'm damned if I do!" he yelled.
</p>

<p>
Thrusting his hand into his pocket, he pulled out
the Nadir Bandar.
</p>

<p>
"I wish," he sobbed, "that I'd never had a wish
at all!"
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
